# What is it?
> Forest gardening is a productive, sustainable and low-maintenance way of gardening, combining trees, edible shrubs and perennial vegetables.

![Bright pink flower bud of Rosa rugosa](img/rosa.jpg)

???

1. Productive
  * Food, wood, etc
  * Multi-layered, in [4 dimensions](/blog/seven-layers-forest-garden/)
2. Sustainable
  * Mineral accumulators & nitrogen fixing plants
  * Wild predators & pollinators
  * Permanent ‚Äúliving mulch‚Äù
  * Trees, plants & soil sequester carbon.
  * Biodiverse
3. Low maintenance
  * Resilient!
  * No watering
  * Minimal weeding
  * No dig
  * No fertilisers
  * No compost

# Scientifically efficient üë©‚Äçüî¨

Efficiency is the ratio of the _input_ to the output.

```html
    Animal          1 :  0.8

    Arable          1 :  4.0

    Forest Garden¬π  1 : 40.0
```

* See sustainable agriculture eg [Tolhurst Organic](http://www.tolhurstorganic.co.uk/about-us/why-choose-us/)
* Proviso: once established
* Perennial plants are less work
* No compost bins, compost in situ

# Propagation bed

![Raised bed made of railway sleepers](img/bed.jpg)

???

* Raised bed at Forest Garden Wales

---

# 5. Sheet mulch

* Quality plastic woven sheet mulch, 3-4m wide
* Re-usable metal pegs
* **Weigh it down!**
* 6 months grass, 12 months dandelions
* Consider using less more efficiently!

![Woven plastic sheet mulch weighed down with wood](img/sheetmulch.jpg)

???

* Use meadow as ground cover until ready to sheet mulch
* Decent make Mypex, Phormisol
* Martin Crawford uses Phormisol 100g weight

---

# Chalk circles

![Photo of circles of lime powder around tree and shrub markers](img/limecircles.jpg)

???

* Use [magic bamboo marker](https://www.flickr.com/photos/forestgardenwales/28391494269/in/photolist-KfRQ6T) with string, tied with knots every 0.5m
* Bucket of powdered lime

# 7. Establish ground cover

1. Spread bark or wood chip* mulch
2. Plant ground cover
3. Sow temporary cover

![Bark mulch, Vinca minor and Sinapis alba temporary ground cover](img/groundcover.jpg)

???

* *See [Myths, Miracles or Marketing? Wood Chip Mulch](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) on [Horticultural Myths](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) by Professor Linda Chalker-Scott
* Mark out shrubs with bamboo, write name, height x diameter
* Bark approx 1.5 tonne per 100m¬≤. [Newbridge Sawmills](http://www.jamesdaviessawmills.co.uk/) near Cenarth sells it for ¬£38.50 +VAT per tonne, on industrial trailer only, weekdays.
* For large areas (ie acres), consider wood chipper for mulch & flail mower to keep grass down.
* I have used [Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba) (white mustard) with great success, partially overwinters.
* I bulk bought 27kg Sinapis alba from [Cotswold Seeds](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/product/mustard-sinapis-alba) for ¬£50.

# Questions & Answers

* _What is the source for the energy ratios for forest gardening on **Scientifically efficient** slide?_
  [Gerald Leach: Energy and food production](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Energy-Food-Production-Gerald-Leach/dp/0902852558) (IPC, 1976).
* _Are there alternatives to plastic sheet mulch?_
  Yes, there are [biodegradable plastics](http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/FS103E/FS103E.pdf) and papers. Considerably more expensive and not as reusable.
