## What we‚Äôll learn

* Why it‚Äôs worth propagating
* Different ways to propagate
* Most important plants to propagate

---

#¬†Why propagate?

* Money
* Time
* Enjoyment

???

* Approx 5 groundcover plants per m¬≤, anything from 3 to 10
* Just one of 9 areas in 1 acre Ornamental Forest Garden is 260m¬≤, which is 1300 plants. Exactly.
* Double windbreak is shrub about every 0.5m
* NW boundary in Ornamental Forest Garden is about 80 metres long, 160 plants.
* Time: after initial potting, so long as well site, only watering & weeding & waiting
* Enjoyment: great joy grafting Poppit Persawrus, from Bubblegum Tree in Poppit Sands

---

# Sow some seeds!

* Native plants
* Perennial veg 
* Annuals!

???

* Quick fix feedback!
* Why native - RHS, DBIF
* Native: Fennel, Feverfew, Teasel
* Perennial veg: kale, alliums, Turkish Rocket
* Annuals self-seeding flowers: nasturtium, calendula
* In a pot, near the house

---

# Choosing your propagation site

* Close to where you go daily
* Near a water supply, ideally hose
* Easy access for weeding
* Prepare soil: cardboard, compost
* Raised beds, more permanent
* Sheltered

???

---

# Layering

* A lot of ground cover plants
* Strawberries & raspberries
* Pin runner in pot 
* Embed pot in ground

???

* ‚ÄúMother‚Äù beds, runners come off plants
* Pin with whatever works: wire, stone, clay
* Or, just pull up runners if you‚Äôre lazy & it‚Äôs damp
* Embedding pot reduces watering
* Beach Strawberry, Green Strawberry, Nepalese Raspberry

---

# Root cuttings

* 1" long x ¬Ω" diameter
* Place in pot
* Keep watered

???

* Comfrey best known example
* Dwarf Comfrey
* Horseradish
* Garden Sorrel

---

# Division

* Plants naturally form more plants
* Runners sent underground eg mint, bamboo
* New Zealand Flax
* Divide gently, repot

---

# Hardwood cuttings

* Wood that has hardened
* Time of year: Oct-Feb
* Rooting compound? Willow
* Can stick in the ground & forget!

???

* Dogwood
* Willow
* Autumn Olive
* Guelder Rose
* Sea Buckthorn

--- 

# Softwood cuttings

*. Windbreaks & shrubs
*. Grafting

---

# Vernalisation

* Some seeds require chilling period
* Pop in fridge in plastic bag with silver sand
* Creating a Forest Garden book

---

# Soaking 

* Some seeds need soaking

---

# Grafting

* Useful to learn if this is your day job
* Great fun & satisfaction
* Scion & ???
* Practise with knife
* Pruning pliers

???

* Ornamental Forest Garden has 5 trees, currently ¬£20ish per tree, ¬£100 total, not really worth saving ¬£40!
