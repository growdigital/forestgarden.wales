* The drive: Climate Emergency, Mass Extinction
* Low impact, sustainable
* Scan Martin Crawford book
* Not just edible but you get the point

## Iterative design

* Design
* Build 
* Evaluate

![Illustration of Design‚ÜíBuild‚ÜíEvaluate iterative design process](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_600/v1574023728/iterative-design.png)

* It is a **process**
* **Repeat**! A design is a living thing, see [How Buildings Learn]()
* From software design, generally applicable
* Not 1 thing, it‚Äôs a balance, a combination

# Specific principles

1. **Useful** to someone
2. **Native** plants co-evolved
3. **Aspect** for sun
4. **Soil** pH & structure
5. **Structure** space & shape
6. **Know your plants** for size, sun, soil, native

![Drooping flowers of Dwarf Comfrey](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_480/v1555401964/comfrey-3C1CD837.jpg)

* _For_ someone: soil biota, invertebrate, amphibian‚Ä¶
* Eg edible, habitat, protection, building, mulching‚Ä¶
* **Stacking function** for every element
* Native _generally_ more useful

<h6 class="breadcrumb"><span class="u-underline">Useful</span> ‚Äì Native ‚Äî Aspect ‚Äì Soil ‚Äî Structure ‚Äî Plants</h6>

## 3. Aspect

![Screenshot of Sun Surveyor app](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_480/v1542489153/sun-nov.jpg)

* How is your garden orientated?
* South most, West better than East
* Tall plants North
* _Changes_ across year!

## 4. Soil

![Hand holding crumbly reddish soil](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_480/v1549490875/soil-758A3605.jpg)

* Soil determines what will grow
* [Acidity](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Advice/Profile?pid=239) ie [pH](), use kit
* [Types](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=179#section-2): clay, sand, loam, silt, chalk ‚Äî sausage or [jar test](https://preparednessmama.com/jar-soil-test/)!
* Also consider **rainfall** & possible rubbish

      <li>Think of plants as shapes</li>
      <li><strong>Critical</strong> consideration is <em><a href="https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/tree-spacing-forest-garden/">spacing</a></em> to allow light</li>

* [RHS Plant Finder](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Form) & [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx)
* Choose native, & for ultimate height and width
* [Rootstock](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) determines height of tree
* Consider light, soil, water, other plants
* ‚ÄúRight plant, right place‚Äù!

???

* Where to start learning about plants
* Fantastic online resources

---

# 4. <span class="u-highlight">Design by example</span>

**Example**: Using a practical example to illustrate the design process

---

???

* Design process: Learn by example
  * Outline plan
  * Immovable objects
  * Trees! most important
  * Light!
  * Windbreaks!
  * Paper or digital


The pieces of design -- outbuildings, trees, wants, time, what you have, what you want

* Principles of design
* paper or digital
* if paper, then make outline, then photocopy!! Enlarge, lots of copies to work from and sketch on.
* paper trees
* From patterns to particulars (permaculture?)
* eg A New Garden Ethic -- north america prairie **but** ideas/principles applicable
* add things to list
