# 1. <span class="u-highlight">Design philosophy</span>

* “Working with nature to grow edible crops”
* Importance of native plants to wildlife
* Stepping stone to wider landscape

???

* The drive: Climate Emergency, Mass Extinction
* Low impact, sustainable
* Scan Martin Crawford book
* Not just edible but you get the point
* Benjamin Vogt [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) * Image of cover
* Native plants co-evolved with native fauna
* Strengthen our ecosystems, regenerative agriculture

# 2. <span class="u-highlight">Benefits of design</span>
  
* Moving symbols easier than things
* Documenting observations
* Combine **pieces** into design
* Divide design into doable **pieces**

???

* Design is thoughtful placement of elements
* Concentrate on benefits, not features
* In previous lecture, Survey [Why plans are useful](https://www.forestgarden.wales/wildlife-forest-garden/survey/#3)

## What are the pieces?

* What do you want?
* What is your situation?
* What resources do you have?

???

* What you want: crops, structures, wildlife habitat
* Situation: physical situation, family situation, mental situation
* Resources: time, money, attention

---

## Examples of pieces

* **Structures**: greenhouse, raised beds, compost bin
* **Wildlife**: native flowers, pond, meadow, hedge, log pile
* **Features**: pond, stream, seats, shady area
* **Access**: paths, gates
* **Areas**: veg, fruit, nuts

???

* See [Wildlife garden checklist](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/wildlife-garden-checklist/)

## Iterative design

* Design
* Build 
* Evaluate

![Illustration of Design→Build→Evaluate iterative design process](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_600/v1574023728/iterative-design.png)

???

* It is a **process**
* **Repeat**! A design is a living thing, see [How Buildings Learn]()
* From software design, generally applicable
* Not 1 thing, it’s a balance, a combination

# Specific principles

1. **Useful** to someone
2. **Native** plants co-evolved
3. **Aspect** for sun
4. **Soil** pH & structure
5. **Structure** space & shape
6. **Know your plants** for size, sun, soil, native

* know your plants

* You've done your survey, taken your obs
* But **keep going**! Check where you are, always (attention)

# 4. <span class="u-highlight">Design by example</span>

**Example**: Using a practical example to illustrate the design process

---


???



* Design process: Learn by example
  * Outline plan
  * Immovable objects
  * Trees! most important
  * Light!
  * Windbreaks!
  * Paper or digital


The pieces of design -- outbuildings, trees, wants, time, what you have, what you want

* Principles of design
* paper or digital
* if paper, then make outline, then photocopy!! Enlarge, lots of copies to work from and sketch on.
* paper trees
* From patterns to particulars (permaculture?)
* eg A New Garden Ethic -- north america prairie **but** ideas/principles applicable
* add things to list
*
