# #peatfree

With a lot of help from a lot of people (mostly John Walker [@EarthFGardener](https://mobile.twitter.com/EarthFGardener), I’ve submitted a petition to the [UK Parliament](https://www.parliament.uk) [petitions site](https://petition.parliament.uk/) to ban the use of peat in gardening and horticulture.

It will be “live” for the public to sign some time in the week beginning 17th June, once it’s been checked. You should be able to find it on the site by searching for ["peat"](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions?q=peat&state=all).

I will update this page with details. This is the text of the petition:

```
*What do you want us to do?*

Ban the use of peat in gardening and horticulture

*Background*

Buying peat-based compost contributes to the destruction of wildlife habitats by peat mining & the release of vast amounts of carbon dioxide, the main agent of climate breakdown. To tackle climate breakdown & its impact on our natural world, we need to ban the use of peat in gardening & horticulture

*Additional details*

• 3 million cubic metres of peat sold for horticultural use annually in UK, ⅓ from UK peatlands (IUCN http://bit.ly/peat-horticulture)
• 10 million tonnes carbon dioxide lost to atmosphere annually from UK’s damaged peatlands (IUCN http://bit.ly/peat-CO2)
• Peatland destruction releasing vast amounts of CO2 (New Scientist http://bit.ly/peatland-destruction) 
• Peatlands support many important species & unique ecosystems (IUCN http://bit.ly/peat-biodiversity)
