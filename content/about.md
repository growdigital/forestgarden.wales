# About us

We are in a time of Climate Emergency and Mass Extinction. We need to garden in a way that encourages wildlife and engages people with the wider landscape.

This means wildlife-friendly, organic, low-carbon, low-impact gardening with a native plant bias. [Forest gardening](/definition/) works _with_ nature to grow edible crops.

We are deeply committed to forest gardening as a way of improving our environment, food, health and well-being.

A forest garden is a low maintenance, low energy system of cultivation that mimics the layers of a woodland edge. It is based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants.

The benefits derived from a forest garden include:

* Food
* Fire wood
* Building materials
* Pollinator friendly flowers
* Soil fertility

We started our own forest garden in 2015 when we moved to West Wales and want to share our experience and passion.
