# About us

We are deeply committed to forest gardening as a way of improving our environment, food, health and well-being.

A forest garden is a low maintenance, low energy system of cultivation that mimics the layers of a natural forest. It is based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants.

The benefits derived from a forest garden include:

* Food
* Fire wood
* Building materials
* Pollinator friendly flowers
* Soil fertility

We started our own forest garden in 2015 when we moved to West Wales and want to share our experience and passion.
