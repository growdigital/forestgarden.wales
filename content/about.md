# About us

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1573476908/hoverfly-169-E5ECB490.jpg" alt="Hoverfly on small white flower" caption="Wild pollinators are essential for plenty of edible crops" >}}

We are in a time of Climate Emergency and Mass Extinction. We need to garden in a way that encourages wildlife and engages people with the wider landscape.

This means wildlife-friendly, organic, low-carbon, low-impact gardening with a native plant bias. [Forest gardening](/definition/) works _with_ nature to grow edible crops, so it is a natural space for productive, wildlife and ornamental gardening to come together.

As well as forest gardening, I have a particular interest in gardening with [UK native plants](https://www.forestgarden.wales/wildflower/) to encourage wildlife, inspired by [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com/benjamin-vogt.html)’s book [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic). 

Mainstream ornamental gardening would benefit hugely from gardening with native plants:

* Provide host plants, habitat & food source for wildlife
* Increase gardeners’ awareness of ecosystems
* Resurgence in educated localism 
* Benefit local suppliers of adapted plants
* Reduce emissions from horticulture industry
