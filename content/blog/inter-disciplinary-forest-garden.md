In my previous life as web designer, I attended the leftfield tech conference [dConstruct](http://2012.dconstruct.org) back in 2012. Recently, in a random email search moment, I came across a quote from [James Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29):

> “The unexplored no-man’s-land between disciplines”

And I thought, a forest garden is very much an in-betweeny discipline. Part vegetable, part wildlife, part ornamental garden. The focus is on creating edible crops; working with nature to encourage wildlife is an intrinsic part, as the garden provides its own nutrients, mulch and pest control; the ornamental aspect because it’s a garden to spend time in.
