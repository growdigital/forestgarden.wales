Love/hate social media. 

I need website to promote forest garden courses & tours.

Your website at the centre. Flickr and Google+ as recent examples of stuff going down

Publish Once, Syndicate Site Elsewhere
POSSE

Good news, easy to do with hosted WordPress, and bit less easy but doable with self-hosted WordPress with plugin.

I use static site generator, called Hugo. Way more complicated to set up but as it's my trade, it's what I do. Set up starter kit called Indiego to enable POSSE

Website generates RSS feed. stands for Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary
news feed.
Then that is piped to your social media networks. I use a free service called IFTT. 

BUT

problem is, only published once. and the thing with social media is that it's 24/7/365. Isn't it just.

So, you can schedule your posts multiple times

Went on free social media course by welsh government, chap called Angus.

Main takeaway: write one blog post per week (4-5 hours), then write summaries to automatically schedule (1 hour). 2-3 times per day, over 1 week

I ended up spending $15 per month with Buffer, and using BulkBuffer for the auto scheduling

BUT

is this spamming?
