1. Lay sheet mulch. Rotate your sheet mulching, buy decent woven plastic sheet mulch. Re-use multiple times. Don't cut if possible. Mow grass, keep short. Peg out, metal pegs. **Weigh it down**. 
2. Leave for 6-12 months. Six months, kills of grass. 12 months, kills off deep-rooted perennials. Bramble **will** grow sideways and find a way out! Best to dig out bramble roots, hard work though that is. Works faster in summer. Can take less than 6 months depending on conditions. Do check.
3. Remove sheet mulch. Takes some time! Earth is brown and crumbly. Lots of vole and mice tunnels. 
4. Cover with wood chip or bark mulch. Can use wood chip, doesn't rob nitrogen
5. Plant ground cover at 0.5m-ish spacing (Martin Crawford does steps 4 & 5 other way round)
6. Sow temporary ground cover, helps stop weeds establishing until your ground cover established. Here I use White Mustard, cheapest to buy bulk, Cotswold Seeds 21 kilos is Â£50, enough for a couple of acres. Go halves with someone.

Still need to weed. Dandelion and plantain, just chop 'n' drop weed. Grass, remove, though roots don't get established in soil, just in wood chip.
