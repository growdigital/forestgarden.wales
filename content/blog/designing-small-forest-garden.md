I really think that [your small garden can be a forest garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/small-forest-garden/), because to be a forest garden is more abut the _principles_ than the size. To recap, the principles are:

1. Productive
2. Multi-layered
3. Permanent ground cover
4. Sustainable
5. Low maintenance

I’m working on a fantastic project in Llandeilo, in collaboration with the can-do [Permaculture Tywi](http://www.permaculturetywi.uk). I’m creating the design and then a crack squad of community-minded permies will wreak beautiful acts of creation in just one day.

To start, I visited the site and talked at length with both the client and also June and Anne from the group. We then took photographs of the site, poked around and measured up.

A very useful tool in this process is to look at where the sun will be at different times of the year. There’s an excellent app called [Sun Surveyor](https://www.sunsurveyor.com), which gives you an [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) view across the calendar. 

My first step back home was to create a very rough sketch, in pen and £1 coloured pencils. This was to get some ideas across to the client before creating anything too polished, the “Make the big mistakes early” gambit. At this stage, you don’t have to be specific about plants, just a general sense about their size, habit and shape. Afterwards, you can pick specific plants and even cultivars to suit the spot.
