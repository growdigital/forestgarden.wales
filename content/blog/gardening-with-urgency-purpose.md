I am not a natural born gardener. I’ve come to it late, provoked by the threat of climate change and tantalised by the prospect of a productive, low maintenance, wildlife friendly forest garden. As the saying goes, “There are many ways into a garden” and now I am enamoured of the sheer delight and wonder of this diversity of life, a diversity _that I help create_. Oh, and the scientific nomenclature of _all those plants_ has piqued my completist collector impulses and web designer nerdiness.

Still, the political impetus has not left me; how could it with headlines like [‘We have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN’](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report), and [The Insect Apocalypse Is Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html)? And with two young children, I can’t pretend I haven’t seen the warning signs. Goodness me, even the BBC [has published advice on what you can do](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46384067) (<abbr title="Too Long; Didn’t Read">TL;DR</abbr> don’t eat cows). 

Establishing a forest garden and teaching is my ‘thing’, my small way of contributing to a more sustainable way of living. And it’s so important to make it as accessible as possible

Portraying gardening as a self-sufficiency is a medieval naïve naturalist anti-machine throwback 
divisive, middle class clique,
I think the neo-hippy 
survivalist, unattainable. 
damaging, self-serving


I don’t want to suggest that your garden should be a doom-laden and desperate attempt to shore up dystopian, survivalist future


politics with a small p 
social justice
political awareness -- of the issues
but if you’re struggling to keep your head above water, you prioritise, and political awareness isn't that high up
time and money

forest gardens tick all the boxes:
wildlife friendly
low maintenance
productive
biodiverse

but the message of sustainable gardening needs to be 

We only have 12 years to save the earth. 

forest gardens think of later generations, planting for and thinking of later generations

how can forest gardening help? resilience, biodiversity, self-sufficiency, individual health, understanding of issues with sustainable agriculture (veganism, land use) - agroforestry
also, closer to home, self-sufficiency
forest gardening is not a magic bullet, it is not a cure-all. It is just one aspect -- the central question being: how do we make our gardens productive, sustainable and regenerative? and this translates to how do we make our lives productive, sustainable and regenerative. 
“Traditional” gardening more sustainable - recyleable plastic pots, peat-free compost, locally grown, seasonal plants. forest gardening can be aesthetically pleasing, out to prove this with OFG
opportunity to introduce gardening to people not attracted -- the young, the dispossesed. Community schemes, edible cities, practical, low-maintenance, time-poor people
Some people don't like gardening and that is fine.
gardens bridge the gap between people and agriculture
specialisation of industrial society means link between people and nature is lost
politics with a small p -- every choice you make has an effect, everything is connected
efficiency and scientific rigour, no hippy nonsense.
love is the force, a love of life, 
inefficiency of 
half-jokingly thought of running a course 

multi-functional aspect of forest gardening -- a plant can have many functions (in permaculture, called????) eg Autumn Olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) 5m high & wide shrub, nitrogen-fixer, excellent windbreak, pollinator friendly, edible berries, 

purpose -- produce food efficiently, without excess energy and effort, both yours, fossil fuels and plastic

forest gardening is niche, viewed by some as the preserve of the quasi-mystical permaculture movement. But permaculture central tenet is very valid -- is this action sustainable?

The #ForestGarden survival course for #NoDeal #Brexit is now avaiable. Only (half) joking
