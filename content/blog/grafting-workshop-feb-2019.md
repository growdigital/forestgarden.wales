* Discussion about pollinator friendly flowers. Link to (fuzzy) slide from [@BotanicGardenWales](https://mobile.twitter.com/BotanicGardenWales) slideshow by [@abigailjayne26](https://mobile.twitter.com/@abigailjayne26) <https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1549705446/slide-D7290F0F.jpg>. Also see [Top 10 spring flowers foraged by honey bees for nectar and pollen](https://www.forestgarden.wales/status/190126-springflowers/)
* Excellent fruit tree reference <https://www.orangepippin.com>
* Rootstocks reference <https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/>
* [M116](https://www.orangepippintrees.co.uk/articles/rootstocks-for-apple-trees), recently developed, good disease resistance, harder to propagate, not readly available.
* Can propagate rootstock by hardwood cuttings.
* Triploid apple trees require specific diploid pollinating partners “You will need either one self-fertile apple variety (or crab-apple) or two other varieties which can cross-pollinate each other as well as the triploid variety.” <https://www.orangepippintrees.co.uk/articles/triploid-apple-varieties>
* Crab-apple in a hedge if you don’t have room. Can graft crab-apple on suitable rootstock.
* [M116](https://www.orangepippintrees.co.uk/articles/rootstocks-for-apple-trees) relatively new rootstock, better disease resistance, harder to come by.
* [P22](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=p22+rootstock) rootstock, very dwarf. Can use as a test rootstock, for trying out different varieties and also for creating scions. Also, can use for crab-apple pollinator if limited space and want to grow triploid apple tree.
* “The only way to do this is to start”!
* Recommended, Felco budding knife
* Calendar
  * Dec/Jan Take scion cuttings from 1st year growth, keep in fridge in plastic bag
  * Feb end of, Whip & Tongue grafting
  * Mar-> for cleft graft
* Order for grafting
