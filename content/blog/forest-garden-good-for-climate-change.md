1. Self-sustaining, ie no inputs. Balance Fertility. Plants. 
2. Balanced ecosystem means provides own pest control, own fertility
3. Diversity of species, for health of garden and also more interesting diet. You don't want to eat the same thing over and again!
4. Provides habitat for wildlife. Cut 'n' drop mulching, compost in place, leave brash on the ground or in [dead hedges]()
5. Permanent living ground cover, in the form of [ground cover plants](), means soil is undisturbed and soil life can get established. This includes mychorhizzal fungi network, which helps move nutrients between plants.
6. Trees and  soil life capture carbon. Individual tree captures around ? kg in its lifetime.
7. Retains water, no soil run-off, 
8. Low maintenance, people more likely to stick with gardening, means more forest gardens, means more sustatinable environments. 
9. Grow your own. The more people in the garden, growing their own produce, less they are consuming from elsewhere,
