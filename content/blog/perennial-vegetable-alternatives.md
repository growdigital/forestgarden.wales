I was [twittering away](https://mobile.twitter.com/ForestGdnWales/status/1127656532332642305) with [@BackyardLarder](https://mobile.twitter.com/BackyardLarder) about how a #ForestGarden can feed a family, and thought a table of perennial vegetable equivalents of annual veg would be handy. This is a work in progress, I’ll try to keep it updated, particularly if prodded with suggestions.
