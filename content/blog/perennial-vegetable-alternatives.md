I was [twittering away](https://mobile.twitter.com/ForestGdnWales/status/1127656532332642305) with [@BackyardLarder](https://mobile.twitter.com/BackyardLarder) about how a #ForestGarden can feed a family, and thought a table of perennial vegetable equivalents of annual veg would be handy. 

This is a proof of concept really, it uses [Markdown tables](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) to create the table, but this website doesn’t support Markdown tables yet, so the [@SimpleNote](https://mobile.twitter.com/SimpleNote) page is displayed in an [iframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Frames) (ugh) which means the links don’t work!

Prod me & I’ll add more stuff and make it work properly.
