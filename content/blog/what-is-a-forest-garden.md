I gave another [Introduction to Forest Gardening](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/intro/) talk the other day (press `p` to see the notes), and I rejigged my definition of a forest garden:

1. Productive
2. Self-sustaining
3. Low maintenance

## 1. Productive

* A forest garden is a productive garden, growing food and wood crops.
* It is multi-layered, using all available space in 3 dimensions.

## 2. Self-sustaining

* A forest garden is designed to be a self-contained and self-regulating system.
* It supplies its own nutrients with mineral accumulators and nitrogen fixing plants.
* As a balanced eco-system, the predators naturally keep the pests in check.

## 3. Low maintenance

* No watering (all water on-site)
* Minimal weeding (permanent living ground cover)
* No digging (mostly perennials with some self-seeding annuals)
* No fertilisers (fertility from mineral accumulators and nitrogen fixers)
* No compost (compost in-situ)

The book I always recommend is Martin Crawfordâ€™s [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/).
