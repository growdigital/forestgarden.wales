We started creating a forest garden about 3 years ago. I always recommend people thoroughly read [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) by [Martin Crawford](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about_us/). These are my condensed nugget steps of experience:

Measure the land so you can space your trees. Use a tape measure and trigonometry for a smaller garden, satellite photo & tape for a larger garden. I use the [Theodolite](http://hrtapps.com/theodolite/) app. Also, test your soil for acidity & nutrients; farmers co-ops are cheapest.

Use large grid paper, overlayed with tracing layers. Or use computer software: either screenshot of the map cropped and imported (with the scale) into free drawing program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) or export the map outline into [QCAD](https://qcad.org/en/) (more technical). Create scale circles of trees (tree spacing ¼–½ of combined tree diameters), plan structures and paths. Take heed of utilities.

Set up propagation beds 1m² for range of ground cover plants. Establish half a dozen “mother plants” in each bed. My faves are [Chilean Strawberry](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Fragaria+chiloensis), [Alefoot](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Glechoma+hederacea), [Iberian Comfrey](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=1894), [Lesser Periwinkle](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor), [Nepalese Raspberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+nepalensis). Beds can be temporary: lay cardboard on mown ground, cover with thick layer soil/compost, dig plants in, mulch with wood chip.

Windbreaks mean trees establish much quicker. Make sure you take into account final height and widths. My favourite windbreak species are [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata), [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus), [Juneberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis), [Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+sericea) and [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides). You can also set up a “nurse tree” for exposed canopy trees—I’m using [Broom](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cytisus+scoparius), as nitrogen-fixing and short-lived.

Mark out the position and (final) diameter of your canopy trees with the [‘Bamboo String Radius Device’®](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/sea-buckthorn-willow-walk/), to make sure that tree spacing is ¼–½ of combined tree diameters. Make sure you have pollinating partners if required and that your tree has enough shelter. Take heed of utilities.

It takes 6-12 months to kill the grass. If using woven plastic sheet mulch, buy decent brand like Phormisol and re-use across the site. Use metal pegs to secure, then **weigh down sheet with heavy objects**.

Mark out the position and (final) diameter of your shrubs with the [‘Bamboo String Radius Device’®](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/sea-buckthorn-willow-walk/), although shrubs easier to move than canopy trees!

I use locally sourced wood chip as a mulch, as it’s free and [it doesn’t rob nitrogen](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/403/2015/03/wood-chips.pdf)<sup>(PDF)</sup>. Then I plant the ground cover plants (see step 3). Best to plant in autumn, if not, then spring.
