Talk billed as “plant-driven design” but I was struck by the humanity of the designs, their empathy with people, plants and the landscape. 

watching someone’s professional life flashing by, some sort of convergence, moving toward a point

about the reconciliation of form and function (ie the function of aesthetics).

frustrated artist,
what is the point
art needs no point, no reason, other than itself

attracted to order

* Or, when the function of aesthetics was reconciled in my (troubled) mind
* The tyranny of the visual - what is a garden? Function *and* form.
* My way in via forest gardening
* A forest garden is a balanced garden
* Functional design - wildlife and productive
* Functional form. The function of aesthetics
