# Online wildlife forest garden course

I’m currently filming the new online course, due to be launched February 2020. Please [signup to the Forest Garden Wales](http://eepurl.com/dqwytj) newsletter to be sure of catching announcements and giveaways.

Here is a taster of the format, a small screencast I made for some clients to give them an overview of the design process:

## Proposed course content

**Introduction:** What is a forest garden, why would you want one & the importance of wildlife

0. **Propagate**: it’s never too early to start propagating.
1. **Plan**: where are the sun, the wind, the water and the things?
2. **Design**: using low cost tools to create a plan of action.
3. **Perennial veg**: get a quick return on your initial planting.
4. **Windbreaks**: windbreaks now & your plants will love you 4ever.
5. **Canopy**: plant the big trees, the canopy layer.
6. **Ground prep**: clear the ground to plant your plants.
7. **Shrubs**: once the ground is clear, shrubs away.
8. **Ground cover**: keep the ground covered at all times & at all costs.

If there’s something that you’d like to be covered that isn’t listed, please do email me [hello@forestgarden.wales](mailto:hello@forestgarden.wales) or tweet me [@ForestGdnWales](https://twitter.com/ForestGdnWales), and I will try to incorporate it, in a bonus video if not the main course.
