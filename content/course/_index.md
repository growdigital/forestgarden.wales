# Create a Backyard Forest

Development of the course is on hold for a while, as I’ve had to furlough the business. Please [signup to the Forest Garden Wales](http://eepurl.com/dqwytj) newsletter to be sure of catching announcements and giveaways.

Here is a taster of the format, a small screencast I made for some clients to give them an overview of the design process:
