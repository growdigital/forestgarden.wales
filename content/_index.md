## About us

We moved to West Wales with our young family in 2015 for a greener, quieter life and to plant a forest garden. We set up Forest Garden Wales to promote its practise, via tours, workshops, talks and writing. We’ve planted one forest garden already, with a polytunnel, raised beds, propagation beds and a wildlife pond. A second garden is now in progress, the [Ornamental Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/introducing-ornamental-maintenance-free-forest-garden/), designed to showcase the aesthetic potential of forest gardening.
