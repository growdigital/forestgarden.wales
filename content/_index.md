My name is Jake and I’m a forest gardener and designer. Like all sane people, I’m concerned about the climate crisis and mass extinction. Promoting forest gardening is my small contribution to making things better, for connecting people with their landscape and their wildlife.  I give [talks](/talk), [design gardens](design) and run an [online course](/course/) & [workshops](/workshop/).
