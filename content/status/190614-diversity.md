The wildlife garden talk by Malcolm Berry, [The Dreaded Gardener](https://www.facebook.com/The-Dreaded-Gardener-1403035606578314/) has really stuck with me, the sign of any sustaining and nutritious creative act. I asked Malcolm “What is your favourite wildlife plant?”, after hearing [@swilson09](https://mobile.twitter.com/swilson09) asking [@Kate_Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury) the same on the [Roots and All podcast](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna) (her answer was [hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna)).

Malcolm’s initial answer was revealing; he said he didn’t have a single favourite plant, rather it’s the biodiversity that’s important. And mulling it over, I am starting to understand it more. It’s like asking someone the favourite ingredient of their favourite dish. Well, **all of it, of course**.

Then, like any gardener would I think, he relented, and said [Pulmonaria](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Pulmonaria+officinalis). At least for now.
