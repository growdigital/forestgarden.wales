Ignore my [last status](https://www.forestgarden.wales/status/190522-fruitful/), itâ€™s suddenly turned really busy. Iâ€™m doing some driving work for the brilliant [Grown In Wales](https://www.facebook.com/Grown-in-Wales-Herbs-and-ornamental-plants-317562768260812/) #PeatFree nursery, some remote work (installing [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) on a [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) box if you must know), Iâ€™ve had an autumn booking for a #ForestGarden talk, thereâ€™s a [workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/forest-garden-workshop-tickets-57931615020) on Saturday, another [5 star review on Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/532342), my forest garden neighbour is back up for the week.

I do think quite a lot about the best way for me to promote forest gardening. To make a living out of it would be fantastic. Itâ€™s hard work starting out, it always is, but every little bit of positive feedback is encouraging. There was a really nice chap came on a tour, and I thought it was so exciting to be a small part of helping someone create a beautiful and productive garden. A small dint in a world of shit but a dint nonetheless. 

My feeling is that video is the way to go. One of my favourite podcasts is [Roots and All](http://rootsandall.co.uk) by the talented and thoughtful [Sarah Wilson](https://mobile.twitter.com/swilson09) and sheâ€™s mentioned a couple of times about not being extrovert but having something to say. I think Iâ€™ll have to bite the bullet and shoot some video. West Wales is a long way from most places, and video would help more people and spread the word.  

Anyways, more driving tomorrow, beep me if you see a white van ðŸ™‚
