- Charred brown banana skins. But think of them as vegan bacon.

OMG! Simple #vegan bacon **that tastes like bacon**! Thank you [@bonappetegan](https://twitter.com/bonappetegan) for the idea, which is slightly browned banana peel with the white bits scraped off with a teaspoon, then marinaded for a while in a smoky, salty sauce, then fried.

The smoky marinade recipe is from [Homemade Vegan Pantry](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Homemade-Vegan-Pantry-Making-Staples/dp/1607746778) by [Miyoko Schinner](https://miyokos.com/pages/story):

* 120g soya sauce
* 15g nutritional yeast
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* Â½ tsp liquid smoke
