Big thank you to [The Peoplesâ€™ Orchard](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard) in St Dogmaels for pruning workshop with orchardist [Martin Hayes](https://www.theapplemancan.uk), essential learning for #ForestGarden. Will write up notes from yesterdayâ€™s talks at [@walesbotanic](https://mobile.twitter.com/walesbotanic) plus pruning notes and share them on this website ðŸ™‚
