As [Martin Crawford](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about_us/) says, “for land-based work, you have to be efficient”, and my work at [Glebelands market garden](http://glebelandsmarketgarden.co.uk) has really driven that home.

But just a reminder to myself, _it doesn’t have to scale_. This is important. I am not growing 8,000 leeks for commercial production. Forest gardens are, by design, small home scale affairs. Anything else is agroforestry. And there is cost to improved efficiency, whether it’s brain-power, set-up or materials.
