Fantastic [Jerusalem Artichoke](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Helianthus+tuberosus) harvest in #ForestGarden this year, 3 times as bounteous as the [Oca](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Oxalis+tuberosa). The Oca go well in a mixed veg curry but the Jerusalem Artichoke? Well, nobody in the family will eat them because of the windiness. Last year I tried roasting them on a really high temperature. That didn’t work. This year, they’ve been a marvellous a 2 metre high summer windbreak (though notably no flowers).

Alison Tindale over at Backyard Larder has suggested that [fermenting them](https://backyardlarder.co.uk/2016/12/fermenting-perennial-vegetables/) helps, so I’ve cobbled together a makeshift ginger, garlic and turmeric brine with chopped Jerusalem Artichoke. Kind of like [Sauerkraut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut).

Here’s the [recipe](http://simp.ly/p/n7mJCY):

### Ingredients

* 1 kg Jerusalem Artichoke, peeled & sliced thickly
* 1 head garlic, peeled & sliced
* 2 tsp turmeric powder
* 50g ginger, peeled & finely chopped
* 25g salt
* 1 litre water

### Method

1. Mix everything together
2. Ferment for 2-3 weeks
