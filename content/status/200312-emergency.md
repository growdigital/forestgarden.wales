Gave a #ForestGarden talk last night at [Llangynin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llangynin) Gardening & Nature Club, you can see the talk here [forestgarden.wales/talks/emergency](https://forestgarden.wales/talks/emergency). Not much hand shaking but a very warm welcome. I did launch in to the whole “it’s an ecological & climate emergency” thing a bit. But then, it really _is_ an emergency.

I’ve been thinking about how best to encourage more people to plant forest gardens, and I think the community forest garden is the way to go. And one of the best vehicles for this would be gardening clubs and community organisations. And schools. 

Part of the problem though is the lack of resources and coordination. I’m still editing the [online course](/course), so will probably make it free for community garden participants. I’m thinking about some form of online mentoring/coaching, using a messaging and live video app (something like [Discord](https://discordapp.com) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv)).

The people though are core, it’s all about the people and then the plants.
