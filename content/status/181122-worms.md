I thought worms were ubiquitous the world over but apparently there are whole areas that have evolved without them – according to Brad Herrick from [University Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum](https://arboretum.wisc.edu) on [A Way to Garden podcast](https://awaytogarden.com/asian-jumping-worms-what-we-know-with-uw-madisons-brad-herrick/), in parts of north america “the plant communities that came back after those glaciers receded evolved without any presence of earthworms”. Fascinating 🙂
