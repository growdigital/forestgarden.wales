Learnt about [Wood Betony](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Stachys+officinalis) today, which prevents [“frightful nocturnal goblins and terrible sights and dreams”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachys_officinalis#Folklore). It’s also a handy ground cover plant, using it in a part of the garden I’m working at. Scientific name is Stachys officinalis, which sounds mighty familiar. Another name is Bishop’s Wort; I think I’ve seen it sold as a cultivated flower.

I do think there’s a place for wildflowers in our gardens, surely must be wildflower nurseries out there? (Says he, too tired/lazy to check on the that there computer). In the same vein, see Roots and All podcast [Episode 30: Growing Orchids in Your Garden with Dr Wilson Wall](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-30-growing-orchids-in-your-garden-with-dr-wilson-wall/)
