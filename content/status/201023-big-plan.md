A #ForestGarden draws together wildlife, edible and ornamental gardening into an integrated whole. Working with nature, we’re creating a beautiful, edible ecosystem with purpose. Use native plants where possible, as they’ve co-evolved with wildlife, providing food source for insects. Use universal principles and native plants for that particular location and situation. (Local plants. From a local shop.) This anchors the garden in the landscape, creates a link with the local natural environment.
