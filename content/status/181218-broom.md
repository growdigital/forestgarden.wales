The [Cytisus scoparius](http://temperate.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Cytisus+scoparius) (Broom) seeds arrived today! By the [power of eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Common-Broom-Cytisus-Scoparius-50-Seeds-Tough-Native-Shrub-Golden-Flowers/202355344658) I bought 50 for the princely sum of £2.02 from [KYM Seeds](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/kymseeds). They need [scarifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarification_(botany)), and I’ll sow them in spring, so that hopefully the plants will be ready to plant in autumn.

Broom is a great nitrogen fixing pioneer plant, and makes an ideal nurse shrub ie a temporary shrub that is used to protect a newly planted tree. I’ll be using it in the [Ornamental Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/introducing-ornamental-maintenance-free-forest-garden/).
