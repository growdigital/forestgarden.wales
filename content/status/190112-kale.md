[Taunton Deane](https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/taunton-deane-kale/) and [Daubentonâ€™s Kale](https://backyardlarder.co.uk/plants/daubenton-kale/) planted, theyâ€™re gifts from the lovely & inspirational [@juniew53](https://twitter.com/juniew53) ðŸ™‚.

Theyâ€™re part of the newly [Forest Garden Greenery](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/eat-your-greens-forest-garden-greenery/), together with [Asturian Tree Cabbage](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/cabbage.html), making sure we have plenty of greens for next year! Next Iâ€™ll be trying a [Claytonia sibirica](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Claytonia+sibirica) ground cover and a climbing [Caucasian Spinach](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hablitzia+tamnoides) (Hablizia tamnoides) at the back, both from the excellent [@BackyardLarder](https://twitter.com/BackyardLarder).
