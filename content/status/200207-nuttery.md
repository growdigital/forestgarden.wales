Helped prune an orchard today with [Martin Hayes](https://www.theapplemancan.uk), Pomologist to the Stars. It is a pleasure working with him, it’s like the Tao of Pruning. Effortless. And there was [vegan chocolate brownie](http://simp.ly/publish/L624C8) too, and his lovely dog Lulu, a CoJack (that’s a Cocker Spaniel & Jack Russell mix). 

Past few days I’ve been planting trees in the Nuttery, a very wild patch of rough pasture that’s turning to bramble without the intervention of browsing cattle. Latest additions have been a couple of [Italian Alder](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata) (weeny £1 whips) and a couple of [Stone Pine](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pinus+pinea), also known as Umbrella Pine. Lovely trees.

Plus plenty of [dead hedges](https://www.forestgarden.wales/dead-hedge/). Just in time as there is a storm coming, [bloody great big storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019–20_European_windstorm_season#Storm_Ciara), the strongest winds for years apparently. That’ll be the #ClimateEmergency and the extreme weather events that you’re just not seeing in the mainstream media.
