Sorting Achocha seeds for the year, found these handy growing instructions from [@emmathegardener](https://mobile.twitter.com/emmathegardener) <https://theunconventionalgardener.com/blog/growing-achocha/>. The variety I grew last year from [Real Seeds](http://www.realseeds.co.uk), Giant Bolivian Achocha. Quite late to flower and pretty darned large. Three plants took over half the polytunnel!
