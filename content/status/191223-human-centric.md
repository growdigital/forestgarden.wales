Having a few issues with [Planting in a Post-Wild World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Planting-Post-Wild-World-Thomas-Rainer/dp/1604695536) by Thomas Rainer & Claudia West. From a #ForestGarden perspective, there’s some interesting stuff: the use of landscape archetypes to simplify the design process, designing in communities, utilising layers. But my biggest issue can be summarised in a five word quote from the book:

“Planting exists to please people.”  

As a counter-balance, please read [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) by [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com). And please plant for everyone and everything.
