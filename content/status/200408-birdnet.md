Found the coolest app for analysing birdsong called [BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu) from [The Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/) [@cornellbirds](https://twitter.com/cornellbirds). Record the birdsong and then select the section you want analysed:

And then click the `Analyse` button and it tells you what the bird is:

I have very limited knowledge of birdsong so itâ€™s fantastic to find out what song belongs to which bird. Chiffchaff, Great Tit and Human were all verified today ðŸ™‚

Oh, and check out their [live demo](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/live/), it is brilliant!
