Speaking with a fellow gardener the other day who was clearing some [Blackthorn](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1580765191/blackthorn-7478578144.jpg), said he had a splinter in his finger and had to go to hospital to make sure it was all removed. I didnâ€™t realise but Blackthorn spines are renowned for poisoning, so if you pierce yourself on one, make sure to have it checked out. Some gory details in this [BMJ journal](https://emj.bmj.com/content/21/3/392)
