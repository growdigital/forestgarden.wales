“Everything is connected…” [@Haggewoods](https://mobile.twitter.com/Haggewoods). After [my #ForestGarden talk](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/ldgc/) last night, I realised that one of the reasons I like forest gardening so much is because it is like a model for how sustainable living can be achieved. You can apply the ideas of [working with nature](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) to other endeavours.
