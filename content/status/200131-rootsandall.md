Fabulous [@RootsAndAll](https://twitter.com/RootsAndAll) double-bill podcast [Documenting the Natural World](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-45-documenting-the-natural-world-of-yesteryear/), first with Teri Sayers-Copper talking about the biologist and artist [Marianne North](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-45-documenting-the-natural-world-of-yesteryear/), then [Tanya Latty](https://www.tanyalatty.com) talking about [Maria Sibylla Merian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sibylla_Merian).

It dawned on me one of the reasons I like [@swilson09](https://twitter.com/swilson09)â€™s podcast so much is because of the _diversity_ (plants, gardening, wildlife, ecology, history, science, veganism, feminism). There is an elusive thread and an open-mindedness. Good stuff ðŸ™‚
