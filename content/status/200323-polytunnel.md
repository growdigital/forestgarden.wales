- Polytunnel with new irrigation
---

Pâ€™nawn da fyd, afternoon world. Big lack of posting â€™cos stuff to do, everyoneâ€™s home schooling now. Also been rigging up dripline hosing in polytunnel, for obvious reasons, Iâ€™m keen to get decent harvest across the garden. Dripline is where thereâ€™s a hole every 30cm and is on the surface. I did try soaker hose but found it hard to judge, as it was under the ground, and some beds suffered more than others. 

If itâ€™s of any interest, Iâ€™m using 13mm LDPE pipe where thereâ€™s no irrigation required (ie between the beds on the right), dug into a shallow trench, and then 14mm dripline with 30cm spacing for the irrigation itself. Lots of Tee connectors and end plugs and a couple of L joints.

Whole lot cost about Â£100, with plenty to spare, bought it from [Water Irrigation](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk).

Keep safe out there ðŸŒ³ ðŸ’š ðŸ™‚
