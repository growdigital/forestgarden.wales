A #ForestGarden is a new paradigm. Anni Kelsey, in her new book [The Garden of Equal Delights](https://annisveggies.wordpress.com/book-the-garden-of-equal-delights/), has put this really eloquently: 

“The changes engendered on the journey of becoming a forest gardener so fundamentally alter the relationship between the gardener and the natural world that they are significant enough to be described as a new paradigm.”

This thought surfaced again in when I was thinking about Martin Crawford’s newer books [Trees for Gardens, Orchards and Permaculture](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/tree-for-gardens-orchards-and-permaculture/) and [How to grow your own Nuts](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/how-to-grow-your-own-nuts/). They are both excellent books, chock full of useful information. **But** they are a continuation of his [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) book, they’re not _groundbreaking_ in the same way.

For me, the paradigm shifted when I read Creating a Forest Garden.
