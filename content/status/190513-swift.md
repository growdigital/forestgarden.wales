I saw a swift today! Swifts are on the [amber list for wildlife](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/uk-conservation-status-explained/), so [@Natures_Voice](https://mobile.twitter.com/Natures_Voice) ([RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk)) are running a [Swift Survey](https://swiftsurvey.org/Rspb/Home/Index) campaign. If you see some in the UK, submit your sighting.
