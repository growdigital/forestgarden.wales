A big thank you, again, to [@papaver](https://mobile.twitter.com/papaver) for the inspiration to **keep on writing**. I recently started working part-time at a local, organic, vegan market garden (I _know_, tick them boxes). What I have found is that my blog writing has suffered as a result. There doesn’t seem to be the time, the usual refrain. There’s two forest gardens (yes, **two**, count [them](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/forest-garden-plan-pgi/) [both](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/forest-garden-plan-ofg/)) to nurture, plus annual veg, forest garden [tours](https://www.forestgarden.wales/tour), [workshops](https://www.forestgarden.wales/workshop) & [talks](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talk), my soon-to-be-announced and not-very-secret [Wild Food Corridors](http://bit.ly/wild-food-corridors) project, and then a couple of children kicking about the place. So, I think, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and to skimp on the words.

And then I met up with my neighbour and friend Dan, a forest garden enthusiast who I discovered is also a tai chi enthusiast. I used to practise many years ago, so it was super interesting. There’s a concept of [Song](https://dankleiman.com/2013/04/09/song-or-relaxation-in-tai-chi/) in tai chi, a loose, hanging yet alert relaxedness, and I think there’s an equivalent in forest gardening. It’s an efficient way of working _with_ nature to grow edible crops, not the gym equivalent of traditional hard graft annual beds. I still have so much to learn, in the kitchen and the garden, but it is an exciting journey.
