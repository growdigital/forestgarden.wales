- Gardening things in a box
---

Here’s a few of my favourite #ForestGarden things, all jumbled in a messy box.

Clockwise, from top left:

1. Pre-vegan pruning gauntlets — made from the skin of a dead cow
2. [Showa 310 green gloves](https://www.showagloves.com/showa-310-green) — cheap & immensely cheerful, these are my favourite gardening gloves
3. Vegan [Plano](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0001P0ILK) secateurs pouch — took ages to find
4. [Craghoppers](https://www.craghoppers.com/mens/trousers/waterproof-trousers/) waterproof trousers — about 15 years old & still going…
5. [Silverline 50m tape measure](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silverline-MT46-Open-Surveyors-Measure/dp/B000LFRMC8) — cheap but started falling apart after a couple of years
6. [Wilkinsons Uknown Pruning Saw](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GKQY7OS/) — buy cheap, buy twice! Lock doesn’t work any more…
