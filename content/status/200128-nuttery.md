My #ForestGarden days are varied: designing in the morning, planting in the afternoon, writing in the evening. Put up another dead hedge in the #Nuttery, this time in front of the tiny Hickory ([Carya ovata](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Carya+ovata) 'Weschke'). And I planted an [Elder](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Sambucus+nigra), one called 'Brudet' from Eastern Europe.
