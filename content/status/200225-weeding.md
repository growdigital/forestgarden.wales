Busy day editing the [#ForestGarden course](https://www.forestgarden.wales/course/), then weeding the suckering [Blackthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+spinosa) and deep-rooted [Docks](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rumex+obtusifolius) out of the “Shrubbery” in the forest garden. You can see the clumps of [Dwarf Comfrey](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/75444/Symphytum-ibericum/Details) coming on nicely. I’ll separate some of the clumps out to fill in the gaps. 

I managed also to write a blog post called [Life as the measure](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/life-as-the-measure/), but it’s a bit weird and kind of about economics, so I’m not sure I’d recommend reading it. 

Just ordered a couple of [Ursula K Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin)’s books from [World of Books](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb). I am drawn to writing and words and ideas, though I’m not sure how they’ll manifest themselves in the forest garden.
