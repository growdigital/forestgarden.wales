After a recent talk, someone asked me about a nut tree for a small garden. I don’t have any direct experience but I know that there’s a North American [Sweet Chestnut](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) relative called the [Chinkapin](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+pumila) which I mentioned (more a bush than a tree apparently, with fiddly little nuts). 

I mentioned that it probably wouldn’t bear any nuts for a few years, at which point they said “Well, that’s too long for us to wait!”.

This set me thinking: how about we plant gardens not just for us? How about we plant for birds, mammals, amphibians, spiders, beetles, flies, fungi, moths, butterflies etc? How about we plant for future generations, even though we won’t ever sit in the shade of that tree? Just an idea.
