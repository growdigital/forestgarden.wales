10x more #ClimateChange sense on [@BBC](https://mobile.twitter.com/bbc/) [comedy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00042g3/frankie-boyles-new-world-order-series-3-episode-3), [@FrankieBoyle](https://mobile.twitter.com/FrankieBoyle) with guest [@GeorgeMonbiot](https://mobile.twitter.com/georgemonbiot):

”What we have to do is big, structural political & economic stuff… There are one or two things you can do as a consumer which do make change: switch to a plant-based diet… animal farming has this massive environmental impact. Another one is stop flying. But beyond that, everything we have to do is change the system. We have to overthrow this system which is eating the planet with perpetual growth. Since when was GDP a sensible measure of human welfare? And everything that governments want to do is boost GDP… We’ve got to find a better way of measuring human welfare than perpetual growth. We’ve got to start ramping down all fossil fuel production and leave fossil fuels in the ground… through massive rewilding, ecological restoration, you can draw down a load of carbon dioxide we’ve already produced… allowing the forests to come back, the marshes to come back, the sea floor to recover from trawling… and can take us a long way to stopping climate breakdown at the same time as stopping ecological breakdown. There’s time but we can’t do it by just pissing around at the margins of the problem. We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it.”
