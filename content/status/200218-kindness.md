[@mformagpie](https://twitter.com/mformagpie) has the best bio: Kindness.

I think about this a lot. So much concentration on the process, not the goal nor the ethics. Summed up in a post by [@RichardJMurphy](https://twitter.com/RichardJMurphy), [Not all Keynesian spending is equal](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/02/17/not-all-keynesian-spending-is-equal/). What Keynes “wanted to address was not just an economic crisis, but the oppression of people's hopes and aspirations and their replacement by fear”.
