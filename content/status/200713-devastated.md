Keep grass to a minimum in the #ForestGarden, that is my new motto. We inherited a great deal of lawn and have been gradually reducing the amount. But still, there is always more grass. Piece by piece, I am reducing the width of the existing grass paths, by the polytunnel and the raised beds, hemming the remainder in with lengths of logs and harsh words, because grass gets _everywhere_.

My next project is to build a raised mound from the turf, in time this will be the home of a [Blackcurrant](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+nigrum) hedge to protect the raised beds from the prevailing wind and give some respite to the buffeted perennial kale.

I heard an interesting tip about grass paths: mow them once a week 1 mower wide, and then once every 3 weeks, 3 mowers wide. 

As part of the blackcurrant hedge project, Iâ€™m also removing the sheet mulch from the raised bed areas, and removing the raised part of the raised beds.
