Bore da fyd, morning world. [Hiatus](https://onelook.com/?w=hiatus&ls=a) in the #ForestGarden, I’m having a rethink about tours, garden design, what I really want to be doing and how best to achieve it. Oh, and a fundamental attack on our democracy by the most rightwing government **ever**.

I think I’ll be concentrating more on (remote) [forest garden design](https://www.forestgarden.wales/design/) and an online course, with scheduled tours a couple of times a year. 

The good news, I have an interview today about the [Wild Food Corridors](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/wild-food-corridors/) pilot project, for the next round of funding.
