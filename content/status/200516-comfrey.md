Bore da fyd, morning world. Just wanted to show what a clump of [Comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale) looks like, about 1m tall, 0.8m diameter. This is ['Bocking 14'](https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/comfrey), a sterile cultivar that doesn’t spread as much.

Fantastic plant, use as a [chop ‘n’ drop](https://www.forestgarden.wales/chop-n-drop/) mulch around fruit trees.
