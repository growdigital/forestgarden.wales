[@RootsAndAll](https://twitter.com/RootsAndAll) podcast with Simon Leadbeater [@OurSacredGrove](https://twitter.com/OurSacredGrove) about [sacred woodlands](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-50-sacred-woodlands-with-simon-leadbeater/); philosophical issues we all need to consider: human supremacy (see [@BRVogt](https://twitter.com/brvogt)), our place in nature, wildlife, native planting, individualism, monotheism, colonialism, slavery, reductionist materialism. Basically, what is it to be alive and part of something larger? How do we live whilst enhancing life?
