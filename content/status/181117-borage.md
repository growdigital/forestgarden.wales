Morning world, bore da byd! Borage [Borago officinalis](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Borago+officinalis) is amazing, an herbaceous, hairy-leaved perennial that grows to 0.6m by 0.3m, with brilliant blue flowers from May to August. It‚Äôs a member of the [Boraginaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boraginaceae) family, the same as [comfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfrey), which means it‚Äôs a good [mineral accumulator](https://permaculturenews.org/2015/04/10/the-facts-about-dynamic-accumulators/) with a deep tap root. It‚Äôs also a fantastic pollinator friendly flower (which can re-fill depleted nectar in 5 minutes!). The flowers are used in salads and Pimms üç∏, and a common name is [Cool Tankard](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cool_tankard).

Errata: this is actually [Pentaglottis sempervirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaglottis_sempervirens) (Green Alkanet), a member of the borage family! Thank you #Wildflowerhour for correction üôÇ
