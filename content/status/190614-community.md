Today I started the Community Forest Garden ball rolling. [@FutureGenCymru](https://mobile.twitter.com/FutureGenCymru) (the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales) has a heading [A Resilient Wales](https://futuregenerations.wales/aotp/resilience/), and one goal for public bodies is toâ€¦

> [Map public land to identify and publicise land that is accessible for use by community groups, with the aim of connecting wildlife habitats](https://futuregenerations.wales/aop/map-public-land-to-identify-and-publicise-land-that-is-accessible-for-use-by-community-groups-with-the-aim-of-connecting-wildlife-habitats/)

So, I phoned up [Pembrokeshire](https://www.pembrokeshire.gov.uk) and [Carmarthenshire](https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales) councils. Neither of them had heard of Future Generations (!) but they were very helpful when I spoke to them about setting up a Community Food Forest. Both of them have Property departments, Carmarthenshire has [information online about properties](https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/home/business/council-property/) and Iâ€™m emailing Pembrokeshire direct. I also spoke to Pembrokeshireâ€™s Community Regeneration department, and they have an online [Community Led Information Portal](https://www.pembrokeshire.gov.uk/clip-toolkit). 

Both councils also suggested getting in touch with town councils about suitable property.

It was a good start, hopefully if youâ€™re interested in setting up a community led forest garden, this may be useful ðŸ™‚
