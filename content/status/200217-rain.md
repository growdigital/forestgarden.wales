Great fun today making mini-dead hedges for [Italian Alder](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata) whips with niece & nephew. I would post a photo but still struggling with uploading them. New phone is pretty amazing, £150 for a fast fully featured smartphone with a case and screen protector. Sure, it’s loaded with Google corporate spyware but what price freedom. Hoping to make some videos next week, will be using it tomorrow for exciting new low-maintenance wildlife forest garden project just up the road.
