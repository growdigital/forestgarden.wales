The [Giant Bolivian Achocha](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/cucumberrelatives.html) plants (a giant green jungle in the polytunnel) have started producing _masses_ of fruit, destined for the freezer. Have used them like green sweet peppers, and they taste _really_ green, like that green flavour you have from nettles. Not sure how else to cook them, will try stuffing and roasting the larger ones.
