A #ForestGarden is a great antidote to the sense of powerlessness in the face of #ClimateEmergency & #MassExtinction. Itâ€™s because you are **doing something**, something that grows nutritious food and provides habitat for wildlife. A forest garden is **potent**.

These are my 4 responses to the climate emergency:

* Going vegan
* Stopped flying
* Engaged in political process
* Promoting forest gardens
