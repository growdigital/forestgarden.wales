Feeling a bit glum about the shitshow going down; #coronavirus is one thing, all the lies are on another level. Kind of tired now, seeking solace in the #ForestGarden. Plus [Cop26 cancelled](https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/02/cop26-climate-change-conference-in-glasgow-postponed-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic). Understandable but we don’t really have any time left. And that’s not me seeing that, it’s a world full of scientists. Remember the last time you didn’t listen to the scientists, eh?
