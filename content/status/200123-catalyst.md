Some people are catalysts and [Sarah Wilson](https://twitter.com/swilson09/) is one of them. In her latest [@rootsandall](https://twitter.com/rootsandall) [podcast with Fergus Garrrett](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/podcast-44-fergus-garrett-on-biodiversity-at-great-dixter/) from [Great Dixter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dixter), they talk about biodiversity audits at the gardens. 

To my mind, this is the best thing to happen, the bringing together of ecology and gardens in an informed way; evidence-based gardening for a purpose. 

As I said in reply to [Mitty](https://twitter.com/mformagpie) [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mformagpie/status/1217171697519869952), “overwhelming feeling is the imperative to join up the dots”. Let’s bring together the different but related disciplines (and believe me, they’re all related).
