‚ÄúPatriarchy isn‚Äôt working for us.‚Äù [@AlysFowler](https://twitter.com/AlysFowler) on [@AndrewTimothyOB](https://twitter.com/AndrewTimothyOB)‚Äôs [Garden‚Äôs Weeds & Words](https://www.gardensweedsandwords.com/gwwblog/gww-podcast-s02e05-alys-fowler) podcast. The inclination to control plants, destroy pests, to have [dominion](/status/200122-dominion/) over every living thing, this runs deep in the monotheistic, Judeo-Christian and patriarchal tradition. It is the [fallacy of human supremacy](https://www.monarchgard.com/thedeepmiddle/how-horticulture-normalizes-human-supremacy-as-wildness-vanishes). This is what makes the [The God Delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion) such an interesting read, and [Darwin‚Äôs Dangerous Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's_Dangerous_Idea). Godless but not good-less, **life** as the measure of good. Just an idea.

Oh, the podcast is a great listen and Alys Fowler‚Äôs book [A Modern Herbal](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/311487/a-modern-herbal/9780241368336.html) sounds wonderful üôÇ
