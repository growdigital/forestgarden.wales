[Gorse (Ulex europeaus)](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ulex+europaeus) #wildflower out in the #ForestGarden coppice. Pioneer species, nitrogen-fixing member of the pea family, [can make wine from the flowers](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/14/how-to-make-gorse-wine), which are most bountiful in spring. Makes a decent windbreak hedge. Darned prickly.
