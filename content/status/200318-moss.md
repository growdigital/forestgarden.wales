Bore da fyd, morning world. Felling yesterday in the wood, for next year’s fuel. Now I just have to haul it up the hill, chop the logs, split the logs. I am aching just thinking about it.

If you want some sane economic analysis of what the government should be doing, I can recommend Richard Murphy’s writings [Let the deficits accumulate: they’re exactly what we need right now](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/03/17/let-the-deficits-accumulate-theyre-exactly-what-we-need-right-now/)
