“Death is a shadow cast by the light of life”.

We had a successful #ForestGarden tour today but midway through, one of the chickens was killed by a fox. I didn’t find out until after everyone had left. She was affectionately known as Red Bum, for fairly obvious reasons, and she was a funny old bird with buckets of character. She’s buried next to Stew, who died last week after a short illness.
