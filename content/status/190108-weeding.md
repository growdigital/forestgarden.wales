If anyone tells you a #ForestGarden is #NoWork, then theyâ€™re a-lying to you. I weeded the Blue Bean Border maybe 4 months ago. Mild weather and slow growing [Lesser Periwinkle](http://temperate.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Vinca+minor) means the grass has taken hold. Plus the bed is downhill from the Makeshift Meadow.
