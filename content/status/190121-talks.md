Two fantastic talks at [@WalesBotanic](https://mobile.twitter.com/WalesBotanic) last Friday, by propagator Carly Green [@floramental](https://mobile.twitter.com/floramental) and designer Sarah Price. Complementary and inspirational on so many different levels, thank you both so much! ðŸ˜„

Carlyâ€™s talk was the most immediately practical for my forest gardening purposes, she runs the [Conserving Welsh Plants](https://botanicgarden.wales/conserving-welsh-plants-the-restoration/) garden at the Botanic Garden. I believe the two major challenges today are climate breakdown and mass extinction of species, so itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s responsibility to secure biodiversity. Iâ€™m starting at home  in West Wales, so Iâ€™m really keen to conserve and re-introduce Welsh plants.
