A spot more weeding (mostly grass, Avens and some creeping buttercup) in the Prickly Quad, noticed the [Chaenomeles x superba 'Crimson and Gold'](http://temperate.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Chaenomeles+x+superba) in flower. Beautiful if a bit damp. And “It is noted for attracting wildlife” Cool 😎
