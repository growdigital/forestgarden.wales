A big thank you to Steve Wilson and [The People’s Orchard @peoplesorchardstdogs](https://www.facebook.com/peoplesorchardstdogs/) for the Grafting Workshop today. Such a sense of achievement from grafting two apple trees. The [scions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting) were the Bubblegum Tree from [Poppit Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppit_Sands) (can’t remember its official name!) and [Ashmead’s Kernel](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/ashmeads-kernel), both on an [MM106](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) rootstock. I potted them as soon as I got home, you can just about make them out in the photo in the polytunnel.
