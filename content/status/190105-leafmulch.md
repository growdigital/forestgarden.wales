Managed to mulch a flower bed in the front of the house, ended up using leaf litter, as that’s what we’ve got a lot of. Then I read on [The Garden Professors](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GardenProfessors/) that “The leaf litter problem is primarily in causing anaerobic soil conditions”. **But** this depends on the type of soil, the type of leaves etc etc
