A new addition to the #ForestGarden, an [Ugni molinae](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ugni+molinae) (Chilean Guava) from [St Davids Pland & Garden Nursery](http://www.stdavidsgardennursery.co.uk/). I mean, thatâ€™s where I bought it from. Botanically from Chile ðŸ˜‰. The last one I planted was a bit too young to handle the harsh winter we had.
