I’m having big, sweary outbursts whilst reading [Planting: A New Perspective](https://oudolf.com/planting-a-new-perspective) by Noel Kingsbury and Piet Oudolf. This is why:

_“Planting has to please people…_  
_…in order for natural environments to be valued by humans they have to be liked.”_

_“The role of the gardener or designer is clear…: planting which serves a purpose has to look good too.”_

_pp41_

I have a problem with the _ethics_ of putting human aesthetics centre stage. Plus, **design is not about how something looks**, and it’s time garden design caught up with other disciplines in this regard. And finally, can you imagine someone saying “art which serves a purpose has to look good too”?

I _am_ learning a great deal from the book, about planting styles and techniques but I just wish garden designers started from ecology and then to human desires. (I used a photo of a fungi because it’s a) beautiful and b) not a plant.)
