One of the questions I’ve had a lot recently is “but will a #ForestGarden feed a family of four?”. Well, something along those lines.

The short answer is yes. The long answer is that our family is a long way from that. It’s tricky, setting everything up in the first place, and then breaking out of old shopping and eating habits. Sweet Chestnut bread anyone?!
