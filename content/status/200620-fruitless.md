“Fruitless in the #ForestGarden but the wildlife gets it.”

It’s been the driest spring on record and I have been neglecting the forest garden. This has meant a very poor raspberry harvest. Next year, always next year, I will do better. I’m moving the fruit bushes to a damper spot, away from the rain shadow of the Ash tree. I’m also putting in wood chip paths for better access, and creating an area specifically for perennial veg. 

The plus side, I can do all this. Yes, there is weeding, lots of weeding to be done. But the ground cover has held its ground, and the trees have kept on growing. And, most importantly, the wildlife is eating the few raspberries that have survived. Everybody wins, eventually 🙂
