Nice to see a #ForestGarden on [@BBCcountryFile](https://twitter.com/BBCcountryFile) with [Tomas Remiarz](https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/tomas-remiarz). But only 4 minutes?! And no examination of the **sustainable** aspect of forest gardening, compared to modern land management practises that are having such a devastating effect on wildlife? 

The show is called [Sings of Spring](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000gxqg/countryfile-signs-of-spring), only available in UK to license payers, 13 mins in.
