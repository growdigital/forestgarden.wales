Listened to the rest of [@swilson09](https://mobile.twitter.com/swilson09) [Roots and All podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-24-creating-an-ark-with-mary-reynolds/) with [Mary Reynolds](http://wearetheark.org/about-mary/), about how everyone can create wild spaces. I laughed and I cried, it was quite beautiful. It’s the first time I’ve heard forest gardening mentioned on a gardening podcast (although I’m not widely listened), and it’s the first time I’ve heard someone link a Living Wage to gardening. If you are too busy earning just enough money to live, how can you be expected to care for anything beyond your immediate circle? Social justice and the environment are inextricably linked.

Apart from that, I had a day in front of the laptop at the silicon coalface, barely a minute in the #ForestGarden. The work is for some great people in Kent, and I’m really thankful for it (working with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and a [NAS box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) if you’re asking), although it has reinforced the realisation that I was born to work outside, at least some of the time.

And then, double wildness whammy, I went to see [Malcolm Berry](https://www.facebook.com/The-Dreaded-Gardener-1403035606578314/) (AKA The Dreaded Gardener) talk about wildlife gardening at the [Drefach Felindre Gardening Club](http://www.drefachfelindregardeningclub.co.uk). It was great fun, photos of Cabbage White caterpillar being eaten by parasitic wasp larvae, which were in turn eaten by a Blue Tit, which was eaten by a Sparrowhawk in an “everything’s connected” way. As Malcolm said, “if we encourage the pests, the predators will come back and the dynamic balance restored”. It was so refreshing to see weeds, yes **weeds**, in a professional gardener’s vegetable patch. Proper weeds, with flowers and seeds, bring back the wildlife.
