Not exactly #ForestGarden but still impressed with plentiful #[tomatillo](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/physalis.html) harvest from polytunnel. Have roasted them previously, now trying to oven-dry them at 70°C. Like a citrusy tomato, lovely on pizza.

Also impressed that tomatillo plants pretty robust. A -3°C frost and one of the plants is still hanging on. I think with some insulation, they could last through winter. Either that, or a [solar heated forest garden greenhouse](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/fg-greenhouse-course/)!
