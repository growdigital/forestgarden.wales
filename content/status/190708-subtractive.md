I watched a world, a woodland world, a Gardeners World, a while ago. They practised [#SubtractiveGardening](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23subtractivegardening), a term I have just this moment invented (of course, it’s already somewhere on the internet…). It’s a style of gardening where you let grow what you want to grow, minus the bits you don’t. Ideally suited to meadows & the #ForestGarden (eg subtract the docks, ash seedlings and brambles!)
