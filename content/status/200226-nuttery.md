Yet more staring at my face in slo-mo today, editing #ForestGarden video. So many bloopers that I’ve been multiply spliced, ended up looking like [Max Headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_(character)) (that’s a 20th century cultural ref btw).

As a counter-point, I planted out the remaining trees in the #ForestGarden #nuttery. This is a steeply sloping 1 acre field, gently going over to bramble and bracken in a neglected fashion but, hey, bad vegans. The trees are two [Italian Alder](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata), little biddy baby ones, I hope they’ll be okay. I really like alders, and Italian Alder in particular, such beautiful bark and catkins.

For a bit of variation, I took a chainsaw to an [Elder](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sambucus+nigra) in “Bramley Border”. It’s getting a bit tired, so hopefully a short, sharp, chop will revitalise it. And then pruning some [Buddleia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddleja_davidii). I will use the cuttings in a [dead hedge](https://www.forestgarden.wales/dead-hedge/), which means I’ll probably never have a bonfire again. Hooray for dead hedges 🎉
