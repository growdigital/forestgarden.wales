Thinking about native plants being the language of your specific ecosystem. What is so liberating ist that every place is different, there’s a plant dialect that fits in where you are. I’m slowly learning the lingo, starting with how they look and what they’re called, moving on to how they function, how they fit. Somebody really needs to write a “Garden design with UK native plants”!
