[PFAF](https://pfaf.org/) have a brilliant resource, a full list of species suitable for a windbreak. Trouble is, the list isnâ€™t sortable.

So, Iâ€™ve made a spreadsheet from the list and uploaded it to Google Docs. The link is **[bit.ly/windbreak-spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/windbreak-spreadsheet)**

If you click on `Data -> Sort Range` and be sure to check `Data has header row`, then you can sort by any of the columns. In this example, Iâ€™m sorting by Deciduous/Evergreen column and Height column to find evergreen species that are medium (2m) height.
