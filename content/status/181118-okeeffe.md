“Still — in a way — nobody sees a flower — really — it is so small — we haven’t time — and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time.” [Georgia O’Keeffe on the Art of Seeing](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/15/georgia-okeeffe-flower/) via [@brainpicker](https://twitter.com/brainpicker)
