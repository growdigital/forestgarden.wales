The next public #ForestGarden tour is only 4 weeks away, Saturday 4th July 2018! Tickets £10 from [forestgardenwales.eventbrite.co.uk](https://forestgardenwales.eventbrite.co.uk/) I’ll be expounding the benefits of forest gardening, with tasty cake and coffee, a tour of the great green tangle and you’ll doubtless meet #RonnieBarker, the world famous [@ForestGardenDog](https://twitter.com/ForestGardenDog/).
