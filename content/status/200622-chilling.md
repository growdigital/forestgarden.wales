Phoned up my Mum tonight, like so many millions of people. The conversation turned to [the heatwave in Siberia](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/17/climate-crisis-alarm-at-record-breaking-heatwave-in-siberia) (you might have missed it, cataclysmic climate news rarely makes the, er, news), and I mentioned the [assertion by Professor Kevin Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97e-6-tlZy8) that we need to ditch carbon fuel by 2035. That’s only **15 years** away. “It’ll never happen” my Mum said. “Then that’s the end of humans in the next 100 years” I replied. 

Come on, people. Green New Deal **now**. Demand it, make it happen, for everyone’s sakes.
