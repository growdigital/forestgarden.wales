- Grated sauerkraut-looking Jerusalem Artichoke in kilner jar
---

Just tasted the grated [Jerusalem Artichoke](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Helianthus+tuberosus) [Sauerkraut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut) wannabe and it is **delicious**. Because itâ€™s grated, it tastes saltier than the [previous batch](https://www.forestgarden.wales/status/200104-jerusalem-artichoke/) of fermented Jerusalem Artichoke chunks. Keeping it in the fridge now that it tastes fermented enough, will add it to sandwiches and vegan hotdogs. Oh yes.

The [recipe](http://simp.ly/p/n7mJCY):

### Ingredients

* 1 kg Jerusalem Artichoke, peeled & sliced thickly (or grated)
* 3 cloves garlic, blended
* 50g ginger, blended
* 2 tsp turmeric powder
* 25g salt
* 1 litre water

### Method

1. Blend ginger & garlic
2. Mix everything together
3. Ferment for 2-3 weeks

### Notes

* Ferment it in larger jar, otherwise it will bubble over. 
* When ready, decant it to smaller jar and store in the fridge to slow down fermentation.
* Skim of white scummy stuff of the top
* When you grate the Jersualem Artichoke, it seems to speed up the fermentation.
* You may need to weigh the artichoke down to keep it under the brine.
