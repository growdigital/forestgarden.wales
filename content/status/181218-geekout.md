Measuring the Ornamental #ForestGarden with the [Thedoloite app](http://hrtapps.com/theodolite/), when I noticed the map functionality. Itâ€™s way more detailed than Google Maps satellite view, and so Iâ€™ve traced the outline of the field, exported it as a [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) file, emailed it to myself, converted it into [DXF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF) format using the free online [MyGeoData converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/), and then opened it up in the free open source [QCAD](https://qcad.org/en/) application.

Kabing, as they say, ðŸ¥‚, should be more accurate than the OS map which I started working from.
