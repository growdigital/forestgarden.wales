imageAlt: Long list written in book
---

I have a long list of blog ideas that arenâ€™t being written. Inspired by [@papaver](https://mobile.twitter.com/papaver), who [writes regularly & often](https://www.blackberrygarden.co.uk), Iâ€™ve decided to put the ideas out as long form statuses, like this one. Think of them as [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of the blog world, status scribblings that may at some point be enshrined as [Proper Blog Posts](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/). Or not. 

Also, a big thank you to [@AndrewTimothyOB](https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewTimothyOB) for putting me on to [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com). Itâ€™s a list-making, note-taking, diary-checking way of organising and it works for me ðŸ™‚.
