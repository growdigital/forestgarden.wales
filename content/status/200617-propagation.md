Someone asked me for propagation tips, so here are mine:

1. Get a decent reference book, to make it easy to look up best way to propagate a certain plant. I’m sure I had the RHS [Propagating Plants](www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1405300612) but it’s gone missing! Also, [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) has some handy propagation info the appendix.
2. Have a propagation area near a watering point.
3. Make sure there’s easy access.
4. Young plants need protection, from wind, sun, cold, heat, predators etc. At different stages, different environments can help a huge amount:
  * Heated propagation bed
  * Potting shed
  * Green house
  * Cold frame
  * Weeded & mulched propagation bed
