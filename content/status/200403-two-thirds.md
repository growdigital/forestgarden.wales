Lovely [Growing Greener](https://www.thomaschristophergardens.com/podcasts/edwina-von-gal-perfect-earth-project) podcast by [@TomCGardens](https://twitter.com/TomCGardens) with Edwina von Gal; great idea of #TwoThirds4TheBirds campaign, encouraging gardeners to grow â…” native plants to help halt the massive decline in bird populations. Also, [Perfect Earth](https://perfectearthproject.org/about/our-story) project to encourage gardeners to ditch chemicals.
