Listening to [Jeff Lowenfels](http://www.jefflowenfels.com) [@gardenerjeff](https://twitter.com/gardenerjeff) on the [Growing Greener podcast](https://www.thomaschristophergardens.com/podcasts/jeff-lowenfels-the-soil-food-web), I realised that the  #ForestGarden needs to be evidence-based above and beyond other gardening, because it’s such a paradigm shift for some gardeners and it needs to be proven. 

Simultaneously, I’m aware that there are _limitations to science_. So much depends upon context and framing. From a narrow perspective, artificial fertilisers work. From an ecological standpoint, they’re a total disaster.

Martin Crawford said “traditional agricultural science can’t cope with complexity of forest garden”. That degree of diversity introduces too much complexity. Not to say that it doesn’t work, just to say that it can’t always be measured. And things exist, even when they’re not measured 😉
