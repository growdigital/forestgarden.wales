Yesterday in the #ForestGarden, I idly pondered [Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) (via excellent [@rootsandall](https://mobile.twitter.com/rootsandall) [podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-26-forest-bathing-with-stefan-batorijs/) with [Stefan Batorijs](http://natureandtherapy.co.uk)). I thought about creating something similar for a garden. Love would be at the base(sic), because a garden without love is just a vegetable menagerie. Then, there would be attention, an awareness of what is actually going on. Itervention without attention is wasted work. And then shelter, giving the plants and wildlife a protected place to grow.
