Today’s #DailyFlower is a big one, [Hemp Agrimony](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/7024/Eupatorium-cannabinum/Details), 1.5m high by 1.5m wide. Spreads readily, loved by pollinators, with a long history of [herbal use](http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/a/agrim016.html) too. And it’s an excellent bee and butterfly plant. Some people call it a weed but it won’t be if you plant it in a straight line. (Apologies for flippancy, very tiring day.)
