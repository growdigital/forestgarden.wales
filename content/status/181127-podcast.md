Episode 4 of [@AndrewTimothyOB](https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewTimothyOB)‚Äôs most excellent [Gardens, Weeds & Words podcast](https://www.gardensweedsandwords.com/gwwblog/gww-podcast-s01e04) with [Alice Vincent](https://www.instagram.com/noughticulture/). Fantastic, particularly the squirrel cameo. Andrew, please can you make link to reviews more prominent, on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/gardens-weeds-and-words/id1418870058) and [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/gardens-weeds-and-words)? Would make it easier for people to leave reviews and promote the podcast üôÇ

What struck me was the phrase ‚Äúa garden is a privilege‚Äù. It would be so nice if this were not true, if gardens were a _right_. But the sad truth is that a significant proportion of people cannot afford a garden. **Accessibility**, in terms of land, time and education, seems to be at the root of the problem.
