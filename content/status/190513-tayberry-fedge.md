After my [#ForestGarden talk](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/ldgc/) at [Llechryd Gardening Club](https://www.facebook.com/LlechrydDGC/), Lynda offered some freebie [Tayberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayberry) plants, suggesting they could be trained on the south side of the dead hedge.

Fantastic idea, Iâ€™ll soon be the proud owner of a Tayberry Fedge! ðŸ˜„
