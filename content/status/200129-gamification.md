Saw my friend Antony for coffee yesterday, _very_ interesting conversation about gaming. I have a [free mini-course on how to plan your forest garden](https://course.forestgarden.wales/p/make-forest-garden-plan/) for which I’d like to set up a discussion forum. It really helps to have a _community_ around a course, to help motivate people and share successes and challenges.

I was trying to use [Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_(software)) but had a hell of a challenge setting it up. So when Antony mentioned the gamer chat app [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)), used to co-ordinate multiple players in team-based games, I started taking notes! 

Another interesting insight is the use of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv), a live-streaming platform. I remember the name from my web development days. My idea though is to set up **live-streaming forest gardening**! Can you imagine? “Here we go, here’s another hole for another tree…” or “This is a tricky bit of pruning here, we might have to lose this limb…”

The Gamification of Forest Gardening…
