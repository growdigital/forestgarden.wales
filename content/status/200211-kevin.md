Lovely to meet Kevin McGinn yesterday at [Botanic Garden Wales](https://botanicgarden.wales) (heâ€™s the Science Officer for the [Growing The Future](https://botanicgarden.wales/science/growing-the-future/) project). We talked about the Gardensâ€™ plans for [#PeatFree](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23peatfree) compost and how theyâ€™re trialling different brands, as Iâ€™m part of the [#PeatFreeApril](https://www.facebook.com/PeatFreeApril/) campaign. We also talked about upcoming plans for an incredibly exciting pilot project the Gardens are launching in April, centred around **evidence based gardening**. I ðŸ’š that phrase, where the -ology of botany meets the -ing of gardening.

And there is something properly magical about a botanical garden, a place where all the plants have labels which you are almost duty bound to read as you walk past.
