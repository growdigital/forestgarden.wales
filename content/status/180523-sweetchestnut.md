A couple of years ago, I bought a [Castanea sativa](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) 'Numbo' from [Agroforestry Trust](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/), and it was **hammered** by the slugs, so much so, itâ€™s become multi-stemmed. Should I prune it to a single stem or just let it do its thing?
