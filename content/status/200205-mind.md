I didn’t even hear [Tips to declutter your home](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06ywcv4) on BBC Radio 4, yet it’s had an affect on my life. I heard a description about how you pause and clear your mind before folding your clothes, and then commit fully to the activity. I guessed you can apply this elsewhere, and it’s been working for me writing the [forest garden course](https://www.forestgarden.wales/course/) notes.
