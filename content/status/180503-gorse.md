Itâ€™s gorse of course in the #ForestGarden! Actually, these gorse bushes were down at Poppit Sands but we do have some gorse ([Ulex europeaus](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ulex+europaeus)). Fantastically pollinator friendly, flowers for much of the year. Also a really good windbreak, and nitrogen fixing, and prickly as hell. And you can make wine from the flowers, which smell of coconut â€“ just think, in olden days people would have described coconut as smelling like gorseâ€¦ ðŸ¤”
