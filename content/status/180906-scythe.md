Just been out scything the “meadow” in the #ForestGarden, and accidentally scythed a wasps’ nest. I heard a loud buzzing, then a sting on my arm and I ran for it. Didn’t realise I’d brought in 3 wasps with me, so another a couple of stings in the house! I like wildlife but crikey that hurts! Earlier, I had disturbed a couple of frogs:

A bit less painful, that frog.
