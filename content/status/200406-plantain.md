Iâ€™ve been growing [Bucksâ€™ Horn Plantain](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Plantago+coronopus) in a raised bed, ready to be moved to the in-progress #ForestGarden perennial veg beds. Wasnâ€™t sure how to eat them, apparently theyâ€™re a [common winter crop, particularly in polytunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantago_coronopus), so Iâ€™ve been mixing them in with winter salads. Much sweeter than I would have thought, very pleasant indeed, with a barely detectable hairiness. What is also endearing is that itâ€™s a native plant, [food for at least 24 species of insect](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=4157). Who would have thought, growing food for others as well as for yourself ðŸ™‚ ðŸ’š
