Great advice from [@susanlmorrison](https://twitter.com/susanlmorrison). When designing a garden, ask the three W’s:

1. What will you be doing in the garden?
2. When will you be outside?
3. Who will be with you?

> How are you going to use this space? Don’t tell me what you want, tell me what you want to do. And then together we’ll figure out what that means.
