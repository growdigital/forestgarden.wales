In my chat yesterday, I prepared yet another definition of a #ForestGarden. I kind of like this one:

Forest gardening is a productive way of gardening that works with nature to be sustainable and low-maintenance. The key features are:

1. Mimics edge of woodland
2. Layers of planting
3. Permanent living ground cover
4. Provides its own nutrients & pest control
