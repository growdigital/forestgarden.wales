[@KatCardy said](https://twitter.com/KatCardy/status/1221426305348128768) “Spend your energy not fighting what you dislike, but in building what you love.” Wise words, which means I’m going to stop reading [Planting: A New Perspective](https://oudolf.com/planting-a-new-perspective) by Piet Oudolf & Noel Kingsbury, because I get all sweary about the focus on the aesthetic to the detriment of the function and wildlife. I admire their craft but not how it’s communicated.

Instead, I shall concentrate my efforts on building a Biodiversity Audit for gardeners, a portal and guide into the wilderness, where UK<sup>*</sup> native plants are designed sympathetically in a forest garden framework. A springboard for action into the landscape beyond your garden.

There, positive 💚 🙏 ☺️
