I went to visit Richard and Anna on Monday this week, they have just moved to West Wales and had been on a [forest garden tour](/tour/) last year. It is so refreshing to talk about gardens in general and forest gardens in particular with a neighbour. Indeed, along with another neighbour Dan, they helped prod me into writing [Creating a simple propagation bed](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/howto-propagation-bed/).
