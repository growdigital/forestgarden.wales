- Clearing next to young tree, with bits of dark poo on it

Reminded of [@RootsAndAll](https://twitter.com/RootsAndAll) [podcast with Terry Woods](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-09-terry-woods-fox-a-gon/) from [Fox-A-Gon](http://fox-a-gon.co.uk) when I found a clearing in the grass next to the young [mulberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Morus+nigra) in the Ornamental #ForestGarden. There was poo there too, dark, squidgy poo. I think itâ€™s where the foxes lie in the sun. I could be wrong.
