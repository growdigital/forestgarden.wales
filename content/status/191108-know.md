“For me it’s okay not to know and I find that really refreshing. I’m a 55 year old middle-aged man and they bloody know everything, don’t they, they know everything about everything. And actually, **I don’t**. And it’s really, really liberating to be able to go “I haven’t got a clue what that is mate, I really don’t know. But isn’t it beautiful”.
