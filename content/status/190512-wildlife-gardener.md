Listening to [Wildlife Gardening with](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-21-wildlife-gardening-with-kate-bradbury/) [@Kate_Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury) on [@rootsandall](https://mobile.twitter.com/rootsandall) podcast with [@swilson09](https://mobile.twitter.com/swilson09), started me thinking about a #ForestGarden, and how itâ€™s a wildlife garden **because that is how it works**. The natural nutrients and pest-control are designed into the garden, quite literally [working with nature](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/). 

So, although I know very little about wildlife, Iâ€™m inadvertently learning more as I progress along the forest garden path, as itâ€™s in my own interests.

Which then started me thinking, it would be good at some stage to advertise my gardening services as **wildlife gardener**, as this is instantly recognisable to the wider public, way more than **forest gardener**. Time to start digging in to [Wildlife Gardening for Everyone and Everything](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wildlife-gardening-9781472956057/) ðŸ™‚

(Beetle: modelâ€™s own. Absolutely no idea about the species!)
