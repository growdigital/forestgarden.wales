Out with 3yo in #ForestGarden again, today propagated [Ribes uva-crispa](http://temperate.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Ribes+uva-crispa) 'Survivor' (an old gooseberry I found in a hedge). He loved it.

Thereâ€™s still time for [hardwood cuttings](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/when-is-the-best-time-for-hardwood-cuttings/)!
