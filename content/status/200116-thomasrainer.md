Excellent slideshow and article from Thomas Rainer about modular garden design [thomasrainer.com/blog/modular-planting-design-random-by-design](https://www.thomasrainer.com/blog/modular-planting-design-random-by-design). My notes:

* Design plant communities, not individuals
* Modular design: discrete, scalable, reusable units: multiple combinations
* Plant population patterns: based on terrain and dispersal
* Aesthetic legibility through repetition & seasonal events
* Dispersion patterns:
  * Uniform
  * Random - does random exist?
  * Clumped
* Example of matrix (clump & ground cover): clumping [Schizachyrium scoparium](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/66400/Schizachyrium-scoparium/Details), spreading [Festuca ovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festuca_ovina) ground cover
* Plant patterns
  * Matrix
    * Clump-forming
    * Spreading
  * Cluster
  * Structural
* Good matrix species:
  * Andropogon virginicus / ternarius
  * Calamgrostis x acutiflora 'Karl Foerster'
  * Carex sp.
  * Deschampsia flexuosa / caespitosa
  * Festuca sp.
  * Molinia sp.
  * Schizachyrium scoparium
  * Sorghastrum nutans
  * Sporobolus heterolepsis
* Cluster species - terrain and/or bulbs, spreading rhizomes/stolons
* Cluster examples: irises, Lily family, [Eupatorium hyssopifolium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupatorium_hyssopifolium)
* Structural species
  * Trees, large shrubs, some perennials
  * Slightly drifted or truly randomised
* Rinse and repeat! 
* Chart different flowering datesâ€”different drifts will light up whole planting at different times
