Iâ€™m giving a talk about the #ForestGarden to [Drefach Felindre Gardening Club](http://www.drefachfelindregardeningclub.co.uk/2018-Calendar-of-Events/) this Wednesday 6th June at 7.30pm, at the Red Dragon Hall in Drefach Felindre. Very exciting opportunity to talk about the principles of forest gardening. Spoiler: 

1. Low maintenance
2. Wildlife friendly
3. Environmentally friendly
4. Multi-layered
5. Productive!
