Oak Park ground cover in the #ForestGarden finished! Does anyone else swear profusely after a few hours of back-breaking planting? They said gardening would be a calming influence… (btw, it’s [Fragaria chiloensis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Fragaria+chiloensis) on the top and [Fragaria viridis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Fragaria+viridis) on the bottom)
