Had a lovely chat about the #ForestGarden with a totally inspirational gardening podcaster today. I don’t like the sound of my own voice at the best of times, so I think I came across a bit stilted, which wasn’t helped by my writing things down in advance. If you’re not an actor and you read something out, it really does sounds like you’re reading something out. 

I’ve been fretting about the phone call for a few days, a full-on Imposter Syndrome flush (honestly, there are so many more talented and interesting gardeners out there), so the question is, why do it to myself? Why put myself out there and up there, into the public gaze? 

Firstly, because it’s not about me, it’s about **doing the right thing**. The #ClimateEmergency, that great unmentionable media elephant of a disaster over there in the corner busily burning our house down, is only going to get worse. We [cannot rely on governments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa13KrOvE2s), we need to adapt ourselves, and our gardens.

Secondly, it’s enlightened self-interest because I’m publishing an [online forest garden course](/course/) at the end of January 2020. I want to promote and create forest gardens and somehow make a living out of it too.

And finally, because doing that not-so-terrifying-thing-after-all re-defines who you are and clarifies your purpose, through meeting totally inspirational people along the way.
