[Comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale) ['Bocking 14'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphytum#Cultivation) roots, ready for dispatch to #ForestGarden client for propagation. It’s a fantastic mineral accumulator, drawing up nutrients with its deep roots. And a great [wildlife friendly](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=5709) plant as well. Easy to propagate, pop a couple of inches in damp compost and keep it away from slugs. Shoots will come up in spring.

I have a blob of comfrey next to every fruit tree for chop ‘n’ drop mulching.
