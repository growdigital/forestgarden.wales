Gardening with native plants is thankfully gaining traction (thank you [@BRVogt](https://twitter.com/BRVogt)) et al), and Margaret Roach & Ken Druse on [@AWayToGarden](https://awaytogarden.com/which-native-plants-and-how-to-make-room-for-them-with-ken-druse/) podcast are doing their bit too. 

Apart from being better suited to co-evolved wildlife, and providing better mitigation against climate change, native plants also celebrate local diversity and culture, in a way a globalised and homogenous industry never can.

Give the podcast a listen ðŸ™‚
