Spent most of the day in the #ForestGarden, planting [Hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=59) (not sure which one, a big berried north American one though), [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata) in the original forest garden, and an Autumn Olive hedge with a couple of apple trees and [New Zealand Flax](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Phormium+tenax) in the Ornamental Forest Garden. Heavy showers, children, tired nowâ€¦Â ðŸ˜«
