My hunch is that authoritarian governments have a worse environmental record than democracies. This is why I’ve turned so political this past couple of years, because the fate of this planet depends on an inclusive socio-political paradigm that is interventionist but **not** authoritarian. Neoliberalism has failed, environmentally and economically. 

So, I’ll be supporting [#StopTheCoup demo in Carmarthen](https://www.facebook.com/events/2321525561510100/) on Friday 13th September, the #Strike4Climate demo at Pierhead Buildings in Cardiff on Friday 20th September and the #ExtinctionRebellion protests for 2 weeks from Monday 7th October. 

Everything is connected.
