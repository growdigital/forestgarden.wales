Not only was [Wenlock Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenlock_Edge) the location of [Robert Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hart_(horticulturist))’s proto-forest garden in the late 20th century, I just found out that [Much Wenlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Wenlock) was site of the [proto-Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenlock_Olympian_Games) in 1850. Indeed, one of the mascots for the [2012 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics) was called [Wenlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenlock_and_Mandeville).

Wenlock is surely where it’s all happening, not bad for a population of 2,877.
