My [nest box](https://www.forestgarden.wales/nest-box/) design, based on one from [RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/how-you-can-help-birds/nestboxes/nestboxes-for-small-birds/making-and-placing-a-bird-box), uses a 1.4m length of 15cm x 2cm planks. The wood cost £2.15 per metre, works out at £3 per box.

This is a note to self really.
