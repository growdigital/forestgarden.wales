On New Year’s Day, I planted the first #NutOrchard #ForestGarden tree! It’s a [Sweet Chestnut](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) ['Numbo'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/chestnut-castanea-sativa-numbo/), originally from [Agroforestry Research Trust](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk). 

There’s [shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale) bedrock not far from the surface, which was hard work digging. I really hope the tree gets a good purchase. One of the tasks is to erect a [dead hedge](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/dead-hedging-forest-garden/) to afford some protection. I have some Buddleia cuttings and old joists that should do the job!
