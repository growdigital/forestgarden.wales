I’m really impressed with the #vegan website [It Doesn’t Taste Like Chicken](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com) ([@bonappetegan](https://twitter.com/bonappetegan) on Twitter). Not only are the recipes great (I tried the [Puffed Pastry Wrapped Lentil Loaf](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/puff-pastry-wrapped-lentil-loaf/)), the email [drip campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_marketing) (5 secrets to vegan food that even carnivores will love) is spot on too. And then there’s the [use of YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/itdoesnttastelikechicken), “new videos on Wednesdays!”

Overall, excellent, well-photographed, searchable and zeitgeist content. 

Which makes me think of doing the same with the #ForestGarden. I’m well aware the website I’ve built is very bare bones, and I struggle to find content on my own website (and I’m the one who’s written it!). So much about making forest gardening more appealing is the way it is presented. I need to “surface” the content.
