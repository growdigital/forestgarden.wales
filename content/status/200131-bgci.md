These are my notes from ‚ÄòThe Role of Botanic Gardens in Mitigating and Adapting to Climate Change‚Äô by Dr Paul Smith at Botanic Garden Wales. Immensely interesting, layered and thought-provoking talk. Plant biodiversity at heart of how botanic gardens can help with climate change mitigation.

Big question: should botanic gardens promote use of native plants to wider gardening public, thus instigating cultural shift toward greater biodiversity, in our gardens and beyond? I‚Äôll come back to this question‚Ä¶ ü§î

These notes are all over the place, meant for me, although they are on the internet.

* Dr Paul Smith, Sec Gen [Botanic Gardens Conservation International](https://www.bgci.org)
* 20% plant species threatened with extinction
* 50% of land transformed directly by humans
* Diversity important for:
  * Food security
  * Water security
  * Energy
  * Human health
  * Biodiversity conservation
  * Climate change mitigation
* 3,000 botanic gardens across the world
* 60,000 plant scientists
* 120,000 (‚Öì) grown in world‚Äôs botanic gardens
* ‚ÄúThere is no _technical_ reason why any plant should go extinct‚Äù

## Adapting agriculture to climate chnage project

* [Crop Wild Relatives](https://www.bgci.org)
* Research of CRWs, showed 53% not in see banks, 20% (of these?), threatened in situ
* $50m grant from Norway to collect species
* 80% world‚Äôs calories from 20(?) species
* 50 calories from what, rice & maize
* ‚ÄúSmoke seed germination‚Äù, nut tree in Botswana, ability to propagate seed
* Helped set up [UK National Tree Seed Project](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/projects/uk-national-tree-seed-project)

## Climate change mitigation

* [International Plant Sentinel Network](https://www.plantsentinel.org) - early warning network, eg ash specimens in eastern Europe
* [The Bonn Challenge](https://www.bonnchallenge.org), 300 Mha land promised to sequester carbon
* **But** problems with mono-culture of non-native species eg eucalyptus in Africa
* Also, issues with native species (knowledge, cost)
* Biodiverse restoration at scale?
* Gulf between science & policy
* [The Ecological Restoration Alliance](https://www.bgci.org/our-work/projects-and-case-studies/ecological-restoration-alliance-of-botanic-gardens/) of Botanic Gardens 
  * ‚ÄúEvery variable controlled & recorded‚Äú
  * Is this incompatible with more laissez-faire rewilding?
  * After certain time, once pioneer species established?
