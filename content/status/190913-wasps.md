Noticed a large wasp (the queen?) being chased off by other wasps, who were munching on a stem of [Jerusalem Artichoke](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Helianthus+tuberosus) in the #ForestGarden. Noticed this chewing behaviour on some sunflowers a couple of years, so bad they killed the plants!
