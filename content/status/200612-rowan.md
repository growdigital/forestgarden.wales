This was supposed to be a [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) in the #ForestGarden windbreak hedge. I donâ€™t think so, looks more like a [Rowan Tree](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Sorbus+aucuparia) to me! Trouble is, itâ€™s directly under a 12 metre high telephone line, and I think they grow to 15 metres tall ðŸ¤”
