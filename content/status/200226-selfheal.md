My #WildFlowerDay is [Selfheal](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/13944/Prunella-vulgaris/Details), mixing it up a little with my daily look at a UK #native #WildFlower. Maximum height and spread is 50cm, those little purpley flowers, such a _familiar_ plant yet Iâ€™ve never bothered to find out its name. Apparently prefers neutral to calcareous soil but sure Iâ€™ve seen it here on acidic West Wales meadows ðŸ¤”. You can [buy plus from The Wildflower Nursery](https://www.thewildflowernursery.co.uk/product-page/selfheal).
