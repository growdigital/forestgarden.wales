Where data meets wildflowers… Native flowers are the future of gardening, so I’m learning by creating a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file of the 50 species sold by [@WildflowerNurs](https://twitter.com/WildflowerNurs). I want to create a [sortable table](https://codepen.io/growdigital/pen/KKpPJPd), so that I can quickly find species that suit my garden designs.
