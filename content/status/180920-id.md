Couple of handy apps for #BugID & #PlantID via [@margaretroach](https://twitter.com/margaretroach) [A Way To Garden](https://awaytogarden.com/go-ahead-we-dare-you-widen-your-plant-palette-with-andy-brand/) podcast, [Leps by Fieldguide](https://leps.fieldguide.net/figures) for butterflies and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) for plants & everything.

I uploaded a [photo of a Speckled](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1544353123/butterfly-42913088460.jpg) from my Leps app on the phone, had an ID within a minute. Pretty incredible, let’s hope the intelligence services don’t have access to that kind of technology. Oh.
