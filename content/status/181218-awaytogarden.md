I received [@margaretroach](https://twitter.com/margaretroach)’s ever-welcome [A Way to Garden](https://awaytogarden.com/about/about-my-email-newsletter/) newsletter the other day, really surpised to hear she [offers a web design service](https://awaytogarden.com/about/need-help-making-or-re-making-a-website/)—on top of the [podcasting](https://awaytogarden.com/category/etcetera/radio-podcasts/), [blogging](https://awaytogarden.com) and [writing](https://awaytogarden.com/say-hello-to-my-newborn-book/) that she does! Oh, and gardening. Worth a look if you’re after a more coherent and polished website: [need help making, or re-making, a website?](https://awaytogarden.com/about/need-help-making-or-re-making-a-website/)
