Yesterday in the Ornamental #ForestGarden I finished mulching the [Cornus sericea 'Flaviramea'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/4412/Cornus-sericea-Flaviramea/Details) windbreak “hedge” with bark. As I mentioned before, the hedge is made from cuttings stuck in a hole in the ground, so it’s very low budget and not very big. But cheap.

Because there’s a lot of [Ash]() nearby, I’ll probably plant out some [Dwarf Comfrey](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/75444/Symphytum-ibericum/Details) root cuttings inbetween the Cornus; the theory being that the deep tap roots bring up some moisture to share with the Cornus, which otherwise the Ash would just suck up (Ash being very thirsty trees). This is just a theory.

In other exciting forest garden news, I have created yet more dead hedges, this time on the western border of the Ornamental Forest Garden. There’s massive gaps in the hedge, and a dead hedge will lessen the impact of the westerly wind.

Dw’i wedi anghofio, bore da fyd, morning world!
