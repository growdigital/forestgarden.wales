Not only did I find out that I’m not getting paid for a day’s work at a [local nursery](https://farmyardnurseries.co.uk), I also found out that the grant application for my [Wild Food Corridors](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/wild-food-corridors/) project in Aberystwyth has been unsuccesful.

So, here’s a photo of a bumblebee on a [Rosa rugosa](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rosa+rugosa) leaf from earlier in the year.
