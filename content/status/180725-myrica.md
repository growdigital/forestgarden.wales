Waiting for the rain to come in the #ForestGardenâ€¦ then I can plant out the damp-loving [Myrica gale](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Myrica+gale) (Bog Myrtle), currently residing in an old bath, keeping its feet damp. It has beautifully fragrant leaves, similar to bay but more perfumed.
