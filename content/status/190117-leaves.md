Weeding in the Prickly Quad, which has [Rubus nepalensis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+nepalensis) (Nepalese Raspberry) as a ground cover (left). Lots of grass clumps and also [Yellow Avens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geum_aleppicum) (Geum aleppicum) (right). Similar leaves but very different root structures.
