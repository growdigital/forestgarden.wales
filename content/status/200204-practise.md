I ðŸ’š [@beep](https://twitter.com/beep)â€™s writing, itâ€™s like he says what Iâ€™m thinking, yet heâ€™s web designer and Iâ€™m a forest gardener. Spooky, right? ðŸ‘». His latest post, [The design systems we swim in.](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-design-systems-we-swim-in/) is about **practise**, a way of doing something. 

This echoes my views about forest gardening. It is a **way** of gardening, with some [key principles](https://www.forestgarden.wales/definition/):

1. Shelter from elements
2. Layers of planting
3. Permanent living ground cover
4. Provides own nutrients & pest control

The _actual_ plants you use depends on a range of different factors: what crop you want, where you live, what wildlife you are encouraging, what your budget is etc.

Central to Ethanâ€™s post is the idea of **situational decisions**, whether the practitioner is empowered to make free and playful decisions. At the crux of this is a question about the very nature of work. Is work is about optimising the production of a product for profit? Or the playful engagement and exploration of the human in the _process_? I think thereâ€™s some serious questions about the economic system we currently operate in ðŸ¤”
