Twitter has been invaluable in organising the #peatfree [@UKparliament](https://mobile.twitter.com/UKparliament) petition, big thanks to [@earthFgardener](https://mobile.twitter.com/earthFgardener), [@DanielR61592267](https://mobile.twitter.com/DanielR61592267), [@swilson09](https://twitter.com/swilson09), 
[@Saralimback](https://mobile.twitter.com/Saralimback) and [@Haggewoods](https://mobile.twitter.com/Haggewoods), the 5 founding signatories ðŸ˜„

Hereâ€™s an excerpt from the confirmatory email from 10 June:

> 5 people have supported your petition so far. Weâ€™re checking your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does, weâ€™ll publish it. This usually takes a week or less.

So, fingers crossed it should be open to the public from the middle of next week. Will keep you posted.
