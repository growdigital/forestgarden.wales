Had a lovely trip to Poppit Sandâ€™s last week, a huge range of wild plants in amongst the sand dunes. It is one of my favourite places, a real diversity of species and all sorts of lovely surprises, even Sycamore growing in the sand in a protected place.

Iâ€™m also keen to get the image gallery software working on the website, so I can showcase a set of photos. Watch this spaceâ€¦ ðŸ“º
