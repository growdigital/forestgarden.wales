I want to get the #ForestGarden **out there**. It‚Äôs great to be creating a forest garden for the family and visitors but I can feel a Community Food Forest project coming on, pulling together diverse groups, the council, the land. Something to act as a beacon and a pilot project, to borrow [@botanicalmartin](https://mobile.twitter.com/botanicalmartin)‚Äôs phrase, ‚Äúa blueprint for green spaces‚Äù.

So, I need land, people and money. Maybe not in that order. 

[Future Generations Wales](https://futuregenerations.wales/) [@futuregencymru](https://mobile.twitter.com/futuregencymru) has a [Resilient Wales](https://futuregenerations.wales/aotp/resilience/) page for local councils, number 15 is [Map public land to identify and publicise land that is accessible for use by community groups, with the aim of connecting wildlife habitats](https://futuregenerations.wales/aop/map-public-land-to-identify-and-publicise-land-that-is-accessible-for-use-by-community-groups-with-the-aim-of-connecting-wildlife-habitats/). 

I‚Äôll be on the phone tomorrow to [@CeredigionCC](https://mobile.twitter.com/CeredigionCC), [@Pembrokeshire](https://mobile.twitter.com/Pembrokeshire) and [@Carmscouncil](https://mobile.twitter.com/Carmscouncil) to see what‚Äôs happening üôÇ.
