With the storm raging in the #ForestGarden, I’m collecting the seed for [Aquilegia vulgaris](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Aquilegia+vulgaris), thinking of the beautiful flowers for next year. Interesting, [Plants for a Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) say “Because of its toxic properties, this plant should not be taken internally without expert advice”, whereas [Agroforestry Research Trust](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/aquilegia-vulgaris-2/) says “The flowers are edible – sweet, rich in nectar, and the leaves are edible too.”
