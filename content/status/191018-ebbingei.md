P’nawn da fyd, afternoon world. Planting out pot grown shrubs in the Ornament #ForestGarden & noticed a beautiful fragrance — it’s the [Elaeagnus ebbingei](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+x+ebbingei) flowering. Absolutely delightful. Makes a great slow-growing but evergreen windbreak, plus if you’re lucky you get delicious fruit.
