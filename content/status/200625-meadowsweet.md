Finally following my own advice in the #ForestGarden, cultivating from centre outwards. New perennial veg bed, next to the “Predator Strip” of [Brachyglottis](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/86133/Brachyglottis-(Dunedin-Group)-Sunshine/Details), [Meadowsweet](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Filipendula+ulmaria) & [Sweet Cicely](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Myrrhis+odorata) (so-called because the flowers attract predators). Now is the time of Meadowsweet, absolutely gorgeous native wildlflower. I was weeding & mulching, all at eye-level with the flowers, and there was a moment of peace & serenity, one that is always there but only occasionally acknowledged.
