Is it a conceit to use #BAME emoticons? 🤷🏿

In a previous life, I was a web designer. One day, I edited the **default** order of titles on a dropdown web form:

* Ms
* Miss
* Mrs
* Mr

I didn’t get sacked or anything, just asked to stop messing about and change it back to the **default**.

By using BAME emoticons, rather than the **default** yellow, is it making a difference? 🤔
