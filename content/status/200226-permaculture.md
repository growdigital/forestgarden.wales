I wrote a post for [Permaculture Research Institute](https://permaculturenews.org) [@PRIaustralia](https://twitter.com/PRIaustralia), called [Four Things For An Orchard](https://permaculturenews.org/2020/02/24/four-things-for-an-orchard/). Spoiler: itâ€™s really about the #ForestGarden ðŸŒ³ ðŸ˜† ðŸ’š

The idea of sustainable and regenerative living that permeates permaculture is also at the heart of a forest garden. What I find really interesting is that permaculture is generally full of young people, as compared to gardening which is generally full of, er, not-so-young people. For this reason, I think forest gardening is a great introduciton to gardening for The Youth.
