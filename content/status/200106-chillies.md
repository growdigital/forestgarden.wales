Top tip: freeze whole chillies rather than chop them up. The chilli harvest of semi-perennial [Albertoâ€™s Locoto](https://www.realseeds.co.uk/hotpeppers.html) was very late to ripen this year, ended up with loads of green ones. You can ripen them by hanging them on a thread in a warm place for a week or so and it worked a treat.

And it saves a bundle of time if you freeze whole chillies in a bag. Just take them out half an hour before you need them, or pop them in the [popty ping](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/fun-stuff/24-welsh-words-phrases-just-6387661) for a few seconds.
