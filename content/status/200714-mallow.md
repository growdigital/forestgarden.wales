[Stephen Barstow](https://www.edimentals.com/blog/), the Extreme Salad Man, has written up some interesting info about Mallow over on the [Edimentals and Perennial Vegetables](https://www.facebook.com/groups/273637002647408/permalink/3487065157971227/) Facebook group.

His two favourite Mallow are [Malva moschata](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Malva+moschata) (Musk Mallow) as a salad plant, and [Malva alcea](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Malva+alcea) (Hollyhock Mallow), which is longer-lived and bigger. [Malva verticillata](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Malva+verticillata) (Chinese Mallow) is a tall annual, and [Malva sylvestris](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Malva+sylvestris) (Common Mallow) is quite short-lived and not very frost hardy.
