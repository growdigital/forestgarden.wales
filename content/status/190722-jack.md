Jack [@JackWallington](https://mobile.twitter.com/JackWallington) wrote a reflective post [On the verge of a new way of gardening: do we need to change what we grow?](https://www.jackwallington.com/on-the-verge-of-a-new-way-of-gardening-do-we-need-to-change-what-we-grow/). Iâ€™d like to see more reflection and less opinion; more kindness, less belligerence. 

Have a read.

> does this mean we should move to a world where we grow no ornamental non-natives at all

This is the bit that stuck with me. I believe _any_ garden is an intervention and that there is space for rewilding _and_ edible and ornamental gardens. [Mary Reynolds](http://marymary.ie) talks passionately on [Roots and All podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-24-creating-an-ark-with-mary-reynolds/) actively putting space aside for wildlife. And there is space enough for humans too.

What I would say is that **every garden should be a wildlife garden**, by designing in wild untouched patches, an area of (native) meadow and a pond no matter how small, and also by adding natives to the plant design and choosing _beneficial_ non-natives, such as the pollinator-friendly [Poached Egg Plant]() pictured above.

Ideally, youâ€™d want a wildlife friendly and complementary mix of natives and non-natives, edible and multi-functional, ornamental and useful. Oh, look, a forest gardenâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
