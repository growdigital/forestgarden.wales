Thank you to [Julian Wormald](https://thegardenimpressionists.com/) for lovely talk on snowdrops at [Llechryd Gardening Club](https://www.facebook.com/LlechrydDGC/), where I might accidentally have bought a snowdrop… You can just about see it in the photo, the soil is a bit sandy but light woodland shade, so hopefully it’ll propagate.
