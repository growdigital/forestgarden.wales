Listening to [Susannah Maidment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susannah_Maidment) on [A Life Scientific](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000d705) podcast, talking about dinosaurs and stegosaurs. Very interesting, about biodiversity in evolution of dinosaurs and how to date sedimentary rock (itâ€™s difficult and depends). 

Key point for me was the mention of [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias) ie areas where people look for dinosaurs are areas where there is a greater number and variety of dinosaurs found. Ditto wildlife.
