Every #ForestGarden should have a wildlife pond. Trouble is, I know bugger-jack-nothing about ponds. But as always, other peopleâ€™s enthusiasm has led me forward (notably [@Kate_Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury) and [@flygirlNHM](https://mobile.twitter.com/flygirlNHM) talking about the [Pond Playlist](https://pondplaylist.fireside.fm) podcast).

I have been pondering [alternatives to woven plastic sheet mulch](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/forest-garden-ground-cover-prep/), which led me to thinking about alternatives to plastic pond liners. Fortuitously, the beneficent and magnificent Ros and Los from [Llechryd Gardening Club](https://www.facebook.com/LlechrydDGC/) paid a visit. They were talking to a friend about my hole in the ground that will one day be a pond (photo above), and she suggested that we use **clay** as a pond liner. Much cheaper (about Â£200 as opposed to Â£1000), easier to maintain (lob on some more clay) and critically **no plastic**. 

There are downsides apparently, that the water level can drop dramatically. Iâ€™ll be meeting up in the next couple of weeks to find out more. 

This really has driven home the importance of knowing how stuff works and what your options are. Iâ€™ll write up a more detailed blog post when I get more info ðŸ™‚
