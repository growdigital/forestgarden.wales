I want a low hedge to rein in the unruly [Rubus tricolor](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+tricolor) (Chinese Bramble) in the #ForestGarden. My accountant mentioned gooseberry, and I thought blackcurrant would do equally well, and now is the time of year to [take hardwood cuttings](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=387).

It’s a bit of triple win - we have lots of blackcurrant to take cuttings from, it’s the right height as it doesn’t need to be a windbreak hedge, and any fruit harvest will be a bonus.
