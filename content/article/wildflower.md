I asked on Twitter about reference material for starting out in the world of UK native wild flowers. [Moira O'Donnell](https://twitter.com/nervousbotanist) and [Martin Allen](https://twitter.com/botanicalmartin) very kindly replied with these suggestions:

* [Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland](https://bsbi.org/about-bsbi) [Get Started](https://bsbi.org/get-involved)
* For ID 
  * [BSBI](https://bsbi.org/)’s [Botanical Keys](http://www.botanicalkeys.co.uk/flora/)
  * [Makaques](http://www.makaques.com/index.html)
  * [FloralImages](http://www.floralimages.co.uk) photo ID
  * [Wildflowers of Britain and Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/groups/735961066428140/) Facebook group
