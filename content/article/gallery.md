The [ForestGardenGallery.uk](https://forestgardengallery.uk/) is a gallery of forest garden photographs of individual plants, examples of individual forest gardens and different polyculture combinations.

The purpose is to show what the plants look like, what different forest gardens look like and what plants work well together.

The photos are all licensed under the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license. This means that they can be shared and adapted, so long as attribution is given and itâ€™s not for commercial purposes.

## Finding photos

There are some very handy websites out there for finding Creative Commons licensed photos. Here are some using Horse Mint (Mentha longifolia) as an example:

1. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha_longifolia) has lots of information about specific plants, and a partner site called [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mentha_longifolia) with extra images with Creative Commons license.
2. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=mentha%20longifolia&license=2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C9) has a Creative Commons filter 
3. Evil [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mentha%20longifolia&tbm=isch&hl=en&hl=en&tbs=il:cl&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwiwoOzF-p_sAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&biw=1905&bih=983) image search has a filter under `Tools -> Usage Rights -> Creative Commons` 
4. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/mentha%20longifolia/) has some amazing quality Creative Commons photos
