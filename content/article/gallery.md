The [ForestGardenGallery.uk](https://forestgardengallery.uk/) is an image gallery of individual forest garden plants. It is organised along the lines of Martin Crawford’s seminal book [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), which mentions over 400 different species:

1. Canopy
2. Shrub
3. Herbaceous perennials & ground cover
4. Annuals & biennials
5. Perennial climbers

Other galleries show plants by function, individual forest gardens, and forest garden features.

The purpose is to show what individual plants and different forest gardens look like, and what plants work well together.

The photos are all licensed under the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license. This means that they can be shared and adapted, so long as attribution is given and it’s not for commercial purposes.

## Spreadsheet

There is a spreadsheet [bit.ly/pfaf-crawford-spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/pfaf-crawford-spreadsheet) of all the plants, using data from [Plants From A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx). 

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1605472927/forest-garden-gallery-checklist.png" alt="Screenshot of spreadsheet" caption="The forest garden gallery checklist spreadsheet" >}}

There is another spreadsheet [bit.ly/fgg-check](https://bit.ly/fgg-check) of which plants and photos have been added to the gallery. These are the different types of photographs of each plant:

1. Whole plant
2. Leafless ie in winter if deciduous
3. In situ, ie in the plant’s natural setting
4. Seedling plant
5. Bark
6. Leaf
7. Flower
8. Fruit, seed &/or tuber

## How you can help

There are about 3½ thousand photos to research, collect & upload, which is way too much for one person! By building a team of say 40 volunteers, we can share the work and benefit everyone interested in forest gardening.

The process of collecting photographs can be divied into 2: the research and the editing.

### 1. Research

1. Focus on the specific plant you’re looking for in the [Forest Garden Gallery checklist bit.ly/fgg-check](https://bit.ly/fgg-check).
2. Write a brief description of the plant, giving latin name, features and height & diameter eg for Italian Alder: `Alnus cordata. Handles drier conditions than other alders. Nitrogen fixing. Very upright. 25m x 8m.`
3. Using the latin or common name, you can search these handy websites for [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licensed photos. Here are some searches for Horsemint (Mentha longifolia) as an example:
  1. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha_longifolia) has lots of information about specific plants, and a partner site called [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mentha_longifolia) with extra images with Creative Commons license.
  2. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=mentha%20longifolia&license=2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C9) has a Creative Commons filter 
  3. [Evil](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/opinion-google-is-evil/) [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mentha%20longifolia&tbm=isch&hl=en&hl=en&tbs=il:cl&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwiwoOzF-p_sAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&biw=1905&bih=983) image search has a filter under `Tools -> Usage Rights -> Creative Commons` 
  4. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/mentha%20longifolia/) has some amazing quality Creative Commons photos.
4. Write a title, alt text description and the image web address for each of the images.

So, this is an example of the text for the Italian Alder:

> Alnus cordata. Handles drier conditions than other alders. Nitrogen fixing. Very upright. 25m x 8m.
> 1. Description: Fully grown tree. Alt text: Tall tree. Author: AnemoneProjectors. Original file: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alnus_cordata_alder_tree.jpg
> 5. Description: The speckledy bark of the Italian Alder. Alt text: Closeup of bark. Author: Jake Rayson. Original file: https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1579861496/trunk-E93CEE1A.jpg

### 2. Editing

1. Add the brief description to the gallery plant album.
2. Create a folder on your own computer with the plant name eg `Italian Alder`.
3. Download the images to the folder and rename something sensible eg `1. Italian Alder full tree`.
4. If necessary, resize the image so that the longest side is **no more than 1400 pixels**.
3. Upload the image to the album, adding the description (including the link to the original file), the [alt text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text) and the author.

The image can’t be any more than 1400 pixels because we have limited space on the web server.
