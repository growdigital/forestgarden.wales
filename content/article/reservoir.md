Martin Crawford has information about creating a reservoir in Agroforestry News vol 23 no. 2, [PDF available online](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product-category/publications/agroforestry-news/back-issues/) (though pricey)

## Key detail

* Design derives from maximum size of plastic pond liner: 25m x 6m
* Each reservoir 3.5m x 20m x 1m deep = 70 cubic metres
* Use gravity fed where possible
* Any water fed into pipes needs to be filtered
* Circulation requires powerful pump, MC uses 4 x 180W solar panels to power [Lorentz](https://www.lorentz.de) pump
* Filter is an upwards-flow (much easier to clean) stone-gravel-grit system, using upcycled 1200 litre plastic water tank (previously used for transporting fruit juice):
  1. Bottom layer 30cm deep, 40mm stone
  2. Middle layer 30cm deep, 10mm gravel
  3. Top layer 30cm deep, 4mm grit
