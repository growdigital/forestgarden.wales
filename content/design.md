## Remote forest garden design

We offer a remote forest garden service which costs £100. This is the design process:

1. Free initial Skype call to see if the service is suitable.
2. We create a basic plan from satellite imagery. 
3. The client provides physical measurements, the basic plan is edited.
4. A sketch is created, showing paths, areas, lightfall and rudimentary planting ideas.
5. When the elements are agreed on, we create a final outline planting plan, in PDF and CAD format.

The process takes a couple of days.
