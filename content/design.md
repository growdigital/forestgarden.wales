# Wildlife forest garden design

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1570786836/greenroom-0.16-display.jpg" alt="CAD forest garden plan" caption="Small and urban wildlife forest garden design for London clients" >}}

My area of interest is wildlife and forest gardening, although I have worked in ornamental gardens as well. I have designed forest gardens for clients in London, Wales, Ireland, Belgium and California! I offer all aspects of a design service, from consultancy to the complete design, groundwork and planting.

## Remote forest garden design

We also offer a remote forest garden service, which costs from £100 for a satellite CAD plan, through to a detailed planting plan with visuals. Here is the pricing:

1. Satellite CAD plan £100
2. Structural & tree plan £150
3. Detailed planting plan £150
4. Sketches/mockups, 2 views £100

The whole process takes about 2 weeks, and communication is via [Zoom](https://zoom.us) video calls, [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com) and email. I use [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) to document the design. The design software I use is [QCAD](https://qcad.org), [available for free](https://qcad.org/en/download). 

The final design is the CAD drawing and the document, which shows the CAD drawing and sketches, gives a walk-through description, a schedule of works, a referenced list of plants and a list of maintenance jobs. Here is a living [example](https://app.simplenote.com/p/JZlZ1N) from a London client.

The CAD file is provided in [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) and [DXF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF) formats, both universally recognised.
