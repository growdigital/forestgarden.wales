Please note, **BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL**. Wellies and waterproofs highly recommended. Also, at the very least, a mild interest in gardening is a prerequisite: the garden is in its early stages and indifferent individuals will only see twigs.

**For group bookings on different dates, please email Jake [hello@forestgarden.wales](mailto:hello@forestgarden.wales) or phone/text on [07398&nbsp;474&nbsp;064](tel:+447398474064).**
