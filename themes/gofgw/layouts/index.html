      <h2>Wildlife & forest garden design</h2>
      <blockquote>
        A forest garden is like a wildlife orchard underplanted with edible shrubs and perennial vegetables. It is productive, sustainable and low maintenance.

      <p>I design forest gardens for clients with small gardens or acres, always with an eye to providing wildlife habitat, and food enough for everyone. I can also implement design if the garden is relatively local.</p>
      <p>I also offer a remote design service, using satellite photos, video calls and other technological delights. Prices from Â£100 for a satellite CAD plan, through to full planting plan with sketches.</p>
