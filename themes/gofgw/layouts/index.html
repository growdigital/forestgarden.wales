      <h2>Wildlife & forest garden design</h2>
      <h3>We are in a time of Climate Emergency and Mass Extinction. We need to garden in a way that encourages wildlife and engages people with the wider landscape.</h3>
      <p>This means wildlife-friendly, organic, low-carbon, low-impact gardening with a native plant bias. <a href="https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/what-is-a-forest-garden/">Forest gardening</a> works <em>with</em> nature to grow edible crops.</p>
      <p>I help clients transform their gardens into productive wildlife havens and offer a remote design service with prices from Â£100 for a satellite CAD plan, through to full planting plan with sketches.</p>
